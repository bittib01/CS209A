    "title": "Can we instantiate an abstract class?",
    "body": "<p>During one of my interview, I was asked \"If we can instantiate an abstract class?\"</p>\n\n<p>My reply was \"No. we can't\". But, interviewer told me \"Wrong, we can.\" </p>\n\n<p>I argued a bit on this. Then he told me to try this myself at home. </p>\n\n<pre><code>abstract class my {\n    public void mymethod() {\n        System.out.print(\"Abstract\");\n    }\n}\n\nclass poly {\n    public static void main(String a[]) {\n        my m = new my() {};\n        m.mymethod();\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here, I'm creating instance of my class and calling method of abstract class. Can anyone please explain this to me? Was I really wrong during my interview?</p>\n"
