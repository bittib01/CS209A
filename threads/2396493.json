      "body": "<p>The classpath is one of the fundamental concepts in the Java world and it's often misunderstood or not understood at all by Java programmes, especially beginners.</p>\n<p>Simply put, the <em>classpath</em> is just a set of paths where the java compiler and the JVM must find needed classes to compile or execute other classes.</p>\n<p>Let's start with an example, suppose we have a <code>Main.java</code> file thats under <code>C:\\Users\\HP\\Desktop\\org\\example</code>,</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>package org.example;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        System.out.println(&quot;Hello world&quot;);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And now, suppose we are under <code>C:\\</code> directory and we want to compile our class, it's easy, right, just run:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-bash prettyprint-override\"><code>javac .\\Users\\HP\\Desktop\\org\\example\\Main.java\n</code></pre>\n<p><br />\nNow for the hard question, we are in the same folder <code>C:\\</code> and we want to run the compiled class.</p>\n<p>Despite what you might think to be the answer, the right one is:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-bash prettyprint-override\"><code>java -cp .\\Users\\HP\\Desktop org.example.Main \n</code></pre>\n<p>I'll explain why, first of all, the name of the class that we want to run is <code>org.example.Main</code> and not <code>Main</code>, or <code>Main.class</code> or <code>.\\users\\hp\\desktop\\org\\example\\Main.class</code>! This is how things work with classes declared under packages.</p>\n<p>Now, we provided the name of the class to the JVM (<code>java</code> command in this case), but how will it (JVM) know where to find the .class file for the Main class? That's where the classpath comes into the picture. Using the <code>-cp</code> flag (shortcut for -classpath), we tell the JVM that our Main.class file will be located at <code>C:\\users\\hp\\Desktop</code>.. In fact, not really, we tell it to just go to the <code>Desktop</code> directory, and, because the name of the class is <code>org.example.Main</code>, the JVM is smart and it will go from the <code>Desktop</code> to the <code>org</code> directory, and from the <code>org</code> to the <code>example</code> directory, searching for <code>Main.class</code> file, and it will find it and it will kill it, I mean, it will run it :D .</p>\n<p>Now, lets suppose that inside the Main class we want to work with another class named <code>org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils</code> and the latter is located in a jar file named <code>commons-lang3-3.10.jar</code> thats inside <code>C:\\Users\\HP\\Downloads</code>. So Main.java will look like this now:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>package org.example;\n\nimport org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        System.out.println(&quot;Hello world&quot;);\n        System.out.println(StringUtils.equals(&quot;java&quot;, &quot;java&quot;)); //true\n    }   \n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>How to compile the <code>Main.java</code> if we are always inside <code>C:\\</code> ? The answer is:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-bash prettyprint-override\"><code>javac -cp .\\Users\\HP\\Downloads\\commons-lang3-3.10.jar .\\Users\\HP\\Desktop\\org\\example\\Main.java\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li><p><code>.\\Users\\HP\\Desktop\\org\\example\\Main.java</code> is because our .java file is there in the filesystem.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><code>-cp .\\Users\\HP\\Downloads\\commons-lang3-3.10.jar</code> is because the java compiler (<code>javac</code> in this case) needs to know the location of the class <code>org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils</code>, so we provided the path of the jar file, and the compiler will then go inside the jar file and try to find a file <code>StringUtils.class</code> inside a directory <code>org\\apache\\commons\\lang3</code>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And if we want to run the <code>Main.class</code> file, we will execute:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-bash prettyprint-override\"><code>java -cp &quot;.\\Users\\HP\\Desktop\\;.\\Users\\HP\\Downloads\\commons-lang3-3.10.jar&quot; org.example.Main\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li><p><code>org.example.Main</code> is the name of the class.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><code>&quot;.\\Users\\HP\\Desktop\\;.\\Users\\HP\\Downloads\\commons-lang3-3.10.jar&quot;</code> are the paths (separated by ; in Windows) to the Main and StringUtils classes.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n"

      "body": "<p>The classpath is a list of one or more files or directories for the Java Virtual Machine to search when it is trying to find all of the various user classes that a Java program depends on for executing. This is a Java VM mechanism and is different from the search path used by the shell for locating an executable file.</p>\n<p>The shell finds the locations for the <em>java</em> and <em>javac</em> commands using the <em>PATH</em> environment variable. The <em>java</em> command uses the <em>CLASSPATH</em> environment variable or the classpath specified with the <em>-cp</em> option to locate user Java classes whose location it doesn't know.</p>\n<p>In addition to the use of <em>CLASSPATH</em>, the Java Virtual Machine will also look for files it needs using the environment variable <em>JAVA_HOME</em> which points to the location of the Java VM components, libraries, etc. Under Linux this is typically a specific JDK version directory hierarchy beneath the pathname <code>/usr/lib/jvm</code>.</p>\n<p>See also <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1053658/how-is-import-done-in-java\">How is import done in Java?</a> which discusses the <code>import</code> directive as well as <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/631682/help-with-packages-in-java-import-does-not-work\">Help with packages in java - import does not work</a> which discusses the <code>package</code> directive.</p>\n<p>This document provides details though it is a bit dated as the Extensions mechanism was removed. <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/findingclasses.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Oracle Java Documentation: How Classes are Found</a>. See the <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se21/html/jvms-5.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">JDK-21 Java VM Specification with Chapter 5. Loading, linking, and Initializing</a> for exhaustive details.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Java launcher, java, initiates the Java virtual machine. The\nvirtual machine searches for and loads classes in this order:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bootstrap classes - Classes that comprise the Java platform, including the classes in rt.jar and several other important jar files.</li>\n<li>Extension classes - Classes that use the Java Extension mechanism. These are bundled as .jar files located in the extensions directory.</li>\n<li>User classes - Classes defined by developers and third parties that do not take advantage of the extension mechanism. You identify the\nlocation of these classes using the -classpath option on the command\nline (the preferred method) or by using the CLASSPATH environment\nvariable. (See Setting the Classpath for Windows or Unix.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In effect, these three search paths are joined to form a simple class\npath. This is similar to the &quot;flat&quot; class path previously used, but\nthe current model has some important differences:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is relatively difficult to accidentally &quot;hide&quot; or omit the bootstrap classes.</li>\n<li>In general, you only have to specify the location of user classes. Bootstrap classes and extension classes are found &quot;automatically&quot;.</li>\n<li>The tools classes are now in a separate archive (tools.jar) and can only be used if included in the user class path (to be explained\nshortly).</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The above document then has this description about finding user classes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>User classes are classes which build on the Java platform. To find\nuser classes, the launcher refers to the <em>user class path</em> -- a list\nof directories, JAR archives, and ZIP archives which contain class\nfiles.</p>\n<p>A class file has a subpath name that reflects the class's\nfully-qualified name. For example, if the class\n<code>com.mypackage.MyClass</code> is stored under <code>/myclasses</code>, then\n<code>/myclasses</code> must be in the user class path and the full path to the\nclass file must be <code>/myclasses/com/mypackage/MyClass.class</code>. If the\nclass is stored in an archive named <code>myclasses.jar</code>, then\n<code>myclasses.jar</code> must be in the user class path, and the class file\nmust be stored in the archive as <code>com/mypackage/MyClass.class</code>.</p>\n<p>The user class path is specified as a string, with a colon (:)\nseparating the class path entries on Solaris, and a semi-colon (;)\nseparating entries on Microsoft Windows systems. The java launcher\nputs the user class path string in the java.class.path system\nproperty. The possible sources of this value are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The default value, &quot;.&quot;, meaning that user class files are all the class files in the current directory (or under it, if in a package).</li>\n<li>The value of the <strong>CLASSPATH</strong> environment variable, which overrides the default value.</li>\n<li>The value of the <strong>-cp</strong> or <strong>-classpath</strong> command line option, which overrides both the default value and the <strong>CLASSPATH</strong> value.</li>\n<li>The JAR archive specified by the <strong>-jar</strong> option, which overrides all other values. If this option is used, all user classes must come\nfrom the specified archive.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See also this explanation about the different types of class loaders: <a href=\"https://www.infoworld.com/article/3700054/all-about-java-class-loaders.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">All about Java class loaders</a></p>\n<p>You can either use the <em>CLASSPATH</em> environment variable to specify the list of files and/or directories or you can use the <em>-cp</em> option with the <em>java</em> command to specify the list. If you use the <em>-cp</em> option then the <em>CLASSPATH</em> environment variable is ignored.</p>\n<p>Using the <em>CLASSPATH</em> environment variable for the classpath is discouraged and there are good reasons for not using the CLASSPATH environment variable. However it can be useful and convenient when a directory is set up with user classes that are commonly used. An example from my recent experience was the .jar file for a database engine.</p>\n<p>The list of files or directories use either a colon (:) on Linux or a semicolon (;) on Windows to separate each item in the list.</p>\n<p>You can use a wildcard in a directory entry to include all of the files in that directory as in <code>/usr/share/java/*</code> <strong>however you do need to be aware that your shell may expand the wildcard so typically you will need to use quotes around a classpath that uses wildcards</strong>.</p>\n<p>The rest of this post is written for Linux as that is what I can test on.</p>\n<p>If you want to use the <em>CLASSPATH</em> environmental variable with some additional files and/or directories on Linux then you can specify the <em>-cp</em> option and include the <em>CLASSPATH</em> environment variable as well.  If you want to search your specific files and/or directories first then search the rest of the classpath, put the <em>$CLASSPATH</em> variable at the end of your list. For example on Linux using the colon separator (and remember the quotes):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>java -cp &quot;$CLASSPATH:/one/two/foo.jar&quot; Mypgm.java</code> will search the addition last</li>\n<li><code>java -cp &quot;/one/two/foo.jar:$CLASSPATH&quot; Mypgm.java</code> will search the addition first</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To check for a <em>CLASSPATH</em> environment variable and its value on Linux use the <code>echo</code> command as in <code>echo &quot;$CLASSPATH&quot;</code> and on Windows use the <code>echo</code> command with the Windows style of environment variable <code>echo &quot;%CLASSPATH%&quot;</code>. The double quotes are used in case the <em>CLASSPATH</em> environment variable listing contains an item that is using wildcard characters such as the asterisk (*) as <code>/usr/share/*</code> though it appears Windows is pretty lax about wildcard expansion.</p>\n<p>You can set the <em>CLASSPATH</em> environment variable at the command line or you can have a setting in your user profile which either creates, replaces, or modifies the <em>CLASSPATH</em> environment variable. How this is done depends on the user shell and how environmental variables are set and what files are processed at sign-in for setting up your shell environment.</p>\n"
