    "body": "<p>Say you have a linked list structure in Java.  It's made up of Nodes:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Node {\n    Node next;\n    // some user data\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and each Node points to the next node, except for the last Node, which has null for next.  Say there is a possibility that the list can contain a loop - i.e. the final Node, instead of having a null, has a reference to one of the nodes in the list which came before it.</p>\n\n<p>What's the best way of writing</p>\n\n<pre><code>boolean hasLoop(Node first)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>which would return <code>true</code> if the given Node is the first of a list with a loop, and <code>false</code> otherwise?  How could you write so that it takes a constant amount of space and a reasonable amount of time?</p>\n\n<p>Here's a picture of what a list with a loop looks like:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/irw1S.jpg\" alt=\"alt text\"></p>\n"
