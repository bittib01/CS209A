    "title": "Should I avoid the use of set(Preferred|Maximum|Minimum) size methods in Java Swing?",
    "body": "<p>Several times I've been criticized for having suggested the use of the following methods:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>setPreferredSize()</code></li>\n<li><code>setMinimumSize()</code></li>\n<li><code>setMaximumSize()</code></li>\n</ol>\n<p>on <code>Swing</code> components. I don't see any alternatives to their use when I want to define proportions between displayed components. I have been told this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>With layouts the answer is always the same: use a suitable <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layout_manager\" rel=\"noreferrer\">LayoutManager</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I have searched the web, but I haven't found any comprehensive analysis of the subject. So I have the following questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Should I completely avoid the use of those methods?</li>\n<li>The methods have been defined for a reason. So when should I use them? In which context? For what purposes?</li>\n<li>What exactly are the negative consequences of using those methods? (I can only think adding portability between systems with different screen resolution).</li>\n<li>I don't think any LayoutManager can exactly satisfy all desired layout needs. Do I really need to implement a new LayoutManager for every little variation on my layout ?</li>\n<li>If the answer to 4 is &quot;yes&quot;, won't this lead to a proliferation of LayoutManager classes which will become difficult to maintain?</li>\n<li>In a situation where I need to define proportions between children of a Component (eg, child1 should use 10% of space, child2 40% ,child3 50%), is it possible to achieve that without implementing a custom LayoutManager?</li>\n</ol>\n"
