    "title": "Something unusual has occurred to cause the driver to fail. Heroku postgresql database",
    "body": "<p>I have created a heroku posgresql database and I am trying to connect my Android app to this database. I am using Android Studio for making the Android app. I have used the following code for creating the connection:</p>\n\n<pre><code>try {\n    Class.forName(\"org.postgresql.Driver\");\n    Connection db = DriverManager.getConnection(dbUrl);\n}\ncatch(Exception e){\n    //handles exception\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When I execute this code I get the following error: Something unusual has occurred tot cause the driver to fail. Please report this exception.</p>\n\n<p>This is the driver I use: posgresql-42.2.12</p>\n\n<p>The heroku database has version 12.2</p>\n\n<p>Android studio has java version 1.8</p>\n\n<p>I am not sure if the driver is in the classpath and I am not sure how to check this. I added the driver to the project this way: app > New > Module > Import .JAR/.AAR Package (here I selected the driver).</p>\n\n<p>To check if the Driver is registered in DriverManager I used this code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Enumeration&lt;Driver&gt; drivers = DriverManager.getDrivers();\ndrivers.nextElement().getClass().getName();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This gives: org.postgresql.Driver</p>\n\n<p>To check if the Driver understandes the URL I used this code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>DriverManager.getDriver(dbUrl).getClass().getName();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This also gives org.posgresql.Driver so I think the Driver is registered to the DriverManager and should be able to connect to the database using the URL. I just really don't know why I keep getting an error when I try to connect with the database.</p>\n\n<p>So why does the error occur and how can I resolve the issue?</p>\n"
