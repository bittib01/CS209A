    "body": "<p>I've always loved trees, that nice <em>O(n*log(n))</em> and the tidiness of them. However, every software engineer I've ever known has asked me pointedly why I would use a <code>TreeSet</code>. From a CS background, I don't think it matters all that much which you use, and I don't care to mess around with hash functions and buckets (in the case of Java).</p>\n<p>In which cases should I use a <code>HashSet</code> over a <code>TreeSet</code>?</p>\n"
