The assignment happens after the method has returned, by which time the task would have already been submitted.</p>\n<p>Therefore, there is no happens-before relationship between the write to <code>scheduledFuture</code> and the &quot;actions taken by that task&quot;, so it is possible for the code in <code>doWork</code> to not see the write.</p>\n<p>This can be verified by running <code>start</code> in an infinite loop,</p>\n<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {\n    while (true) {\n        new RaceCondition().start();\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>with a slightly modified <code>doWork</code> to print something if a NPE is caught.</p>\n<pre><code>private void doWork()\n{\n    try {\n        scheduledFuture.cancel(false);\n    } catch (NullPointerException npe) {\n        System.out.println(&quot;NULL!&quot;);\n    }\n    stop(); // shutdown the executor so that we don't run out of threads\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>On my machine &quot;NULL!&quot; gets printed quite often.</p>\n"
