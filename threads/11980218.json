    "body": "<p>We have configure a Big F5 load balancer virtual server for a particular IP address which redirects incoming https requests to several Windows servers where there is functionality to generate responses.</p>\n\n<p>I am using SoapUI to test access to these windows servers via the IP address of virtual server in the Big F5.</p>\n\n<p>Using Server and Client certificates generated by the organization where the we have also this set up and sending requests via SoapUI I get the predicted responses back.</p>\n\n<p>The business requirements call for Commercially signed certificates by Thawte.</p>\n\n<p>We created a Certifcate Servcice Request (CSR) to generate a Server certificate and its private key and then we had it signed by Thawte, and also requested a Client Commercially signed certificate from Thawte.</p>\n\n<p>We loaded both certificates in SoapUI client and the Big F5 load balancer but we attempting to test the requests we get the \"javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: Remote host closed connection during handshake\" error.</p>\n\n<p>My questions are:\nHow can I monitor where exactly the 2 way SSL handshake is terminated\nThe actual reason what exactly is happening?.. why using commercially signed certificates this does not work now?</p>\n\n<p>Any replies are welcome. Thanks.</p>\n\n<p>However when we swithch Serverto commercially signed by Thawte</p>\n"
