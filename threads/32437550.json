    "title": "What&#39;s the difference between Instant and LocalDateTime?",
    "body": "<p>I know that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Instant</strong> is rather a &quot;technical&quot; timestamp representation (nanoseconds) for computing.</li>\n<li><strong>LocalDateTime</strong> is rather date/clock representation <strike>including time-zones</strike> for humans.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Still in the end IMO both can be taken as types for most application use cases. As an example: currently, I am running a batch job where I need to calculate the next run based on dates and I am struggling to find pros/cons between these two types (apart from the nanosecond precision advantage of <code>Instant</code> and the time-zone part of <code>LocalDateTime</code>).</p>\n<p>Can you name some application examples where only <code>Instant</code> or <code>LocalDateTime</code> should be used?</p>\n<p><em>Edit: Beware of misread documentations for <code>LocalDateTime</code> regarding precision and time-zone.</em></p>\n"

      "body": "<p>LocalDateTime has no time-zone information: one LocalDateTime may represent different instants for different machines around the world. So you should not try to use it with an implicit time-zone (the system's default one). You should use it for what it represents, for instance &quot;New-year is January 1st, at 0:00&quot;: this means a different time at all points on the globe but it's wanted in this case.</p>\n<p>Instant is a point in time at the Greenwich time-zone. Use it in addition to the user's time-zone to show him/her the start of a meeting in his/her time-zone, for instance.</p>\n<p>If these two classes do not represent what you wanted to store/exchange, then maybe ZonedDateTime or another class may do a better job.</p>\n<p>Here is a simple synthetic schema to get the big-picture of the classes in the java.time package and their relation to the ISO-8601 standard used to reliably and effortlessly exchange dates and times between Java and other languages or frameworks:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/UF4J9.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/UF4J9.png\" alt=\"Classes of the java.time package and their relations to the ISO-8601 standard\" /></a></p>\n<p>The schema is explained in details here: <a href=\"https://sebastien.laout.fr/java-date-time/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://sebastien.laout.fr/java-date-time/</a></p>\n"
