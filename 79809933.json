    "body": "<p>I'm starting out with Java and Spring Boot, and I have a fairly simple question that always raises doubts for me, as I always like to follow best practices.</p>\n<p>I have a Controller layer where I create the API calls, then a Service layer that implements the business logic, and a repository layer to manage database actions.</p>\n<p>The question is: At what level do I throw exceptions? What's the best way to handle exceptions, besides creating custom exceptions?</p>\n<p>Thanks</p>\n"
