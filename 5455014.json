    "title": "Ignoring new fields on JSON objects using Jackson",
    "body": "<p>I'm using Jackson JSON library to convert some JSON objects to POJO classes on an android application. The problem is, the JSON objects might change and have new fields added while the application is published, but currently it will break even when a simple String field is added, which can safely be ignored. </p>\n\n<p>Is there any way to tell Jackson to ignore newly added fields? (e.g. non-existing on the POJO objects)? A global ignore would be great.</p>\n"
