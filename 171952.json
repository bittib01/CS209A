    "title": "Is there a destructor for Java?",
    "body": "<p>Is there a destructor for Java? I don't seem to be able to find any documentation on this. If there isn't, how can I achieve the same effect?</p>\n\n<p>To make my question more specific, I am writing an application that deals with data and the specification say that there should be a 'reset' button that brings the application back to its original just launched state. However, all data have to be 'live' unless the application is closed or reset button is pressed.</p>\n\n<p>Being usually a C/C++ programmer, I thought this would be trivial to implement. (And hence I planned to implement it last.) I structured my program such that all the 'reset-able' objects would be in the same class so that I can just destroy all 'live' objects when a reset button is pressed.</p>\n\n<p>I was thinking if all I did was just to dereference the data and wait for the garbage collector to collect them, wouldn't there be a memory leak if my user repeatedly entered data and pressed the reset button? I was also thinking since Java is quite mature as a language, there should be a way to prevent this from happening or gracefully tackle this.</p>\n"

All of the other answers are correct about using try-with-resources and avoiding finalizers as they are unreliable and are now deprecated...</p>\n<p>However they haven't mentioned Cleaners.  Cleaners were added in Java 9 to explicitly handle the job of cleanup in a better way than finalizers.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/lang/ref/Cleaner.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/lang/ref/Cleaner.html</a></p>\n"
