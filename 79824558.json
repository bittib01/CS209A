    "body": "<p>I’m using Payara 7.2025.1 with payara-micro-managed, Arquillian, and JUnit 5. When I run my tests, a Payara Micro instance starts and deploys correctly, but it seems that the tests themselves are executed outside the container. As a result, they always return success, regardless of the actual application behavior.</p>\n<p>I’ve tried searching for any official sources or guides on configuring this exact combination, but I couldn’t find anything.</p>\n<p>My questions:</p>\n<p>Is it even possible to configure Arquillian + JUnit 5 + Payara Micro Managed in a way that ensures tests run inside the Payara Micro container?</p>\n<p>If yes, are there any known examples, guides, or best practices?</p>\n<p>Any pointers would be highly appreciated!</p>\n"
