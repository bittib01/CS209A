    "title": "How to wait for all threads to finish, using ExecutorService?",
    "body": "<p>I need to execute some amount of tasks 4 at a time, something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ExecutorService taskExecutor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4);\nwhile(...) {\n    taskExecutor.execute(new MyTask());\n}\n//...wait for completion somehow\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>How can I get notified once all of them are complete? For now I can't think about anything better than setting some global task counter and decrease it at the end of every task, then monitor in infinite loop this counter to become 0; or get a list of Futures and in infinite loop monitor isDone for all of them. What are better solutions not involving infinite loops?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks.</p>\n"
