    "title": "Selenium execution stops when screen is locked",
    "body": "<p>I can execute my Selenium scripts without any issues if the screen is not locked. As per our organization policy, our system will be locked automatically after 3 minutes of inactivity (but system will never sleep or hibernate). </p>\n\n<p>The problem is that the test execution stops because of <code>NoSuchElementException</code> sometimes after the screen is locked. This exception occurs randomly on different elements after the screen is locked. </p>\n\n<p>So I cannot run my tests unattended I guess. Selenium test should run without any problem regardless the screen is locked. I run the tests on Google Chrome on Windows machine. Is there any work around for this issue? </p>\n\n<p>I could use some scripts to prevent the screen from locking, but it's not allowed in the organization because of security reasons.</p>\n"
