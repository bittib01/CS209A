    "body": "<p>Is there any standard Java library class to represent a tree in Java?</p>\n\n<p>Specifically I need to represent the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The sub-tree at any node can have an arbitrary number of children</li>\n<li>Each node (after the root) and it's children will have string value </li>\n<li>I need to get all the children (some sort of list or array of Strings) of a given node and it's string value(i.e. a method that will take a node as input and return all the string values of the children node as output)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Is there any available structure for this or do I need to create my own (if so implementation suggestions would be great).</p>\n"
