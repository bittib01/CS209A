      "body": "<p>On <em>most</em> OSes, 'files' are abstract and nameless concepts.</p>\n<p>A filepath (i.e. <code>/home/MaxSan/Desktop/myfile.txt</code>) isn't <em>a file</em>, it's more a <em>file pointer</em>.</p>\n<p>Your mobile phone is an object. It has a phone number. But your phone isn't the same as that phone number; the number is merely a way to <em>get to the phone</em>. A phone could have 2 phone numbers. If you pop the SIM card out, it has no phone numbers.</p>\n<p>Files are exactly the same way. For example, on linux:</p>\n<pre><code>echo &quot;Hello!&quot; &gt; test.txt\nln test.txt test2.txt\nls\n</code></pre>\n<p>You now have 2 'paths' (<code>test.txt</code> and <code>test2.txt</code>) but <em>there is only the one file on disk</em>. If you run <code>nano test.txt</code> and modify it, you'll notice that <code>test2.txt</code> is also modified. In java terms, we can show this off too:</p>\n<pre><code>List&lt;String&gt; a = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();\nList&lt;String&gt; b = a;\na.add(&quot;Hello&quot;);\nSystem.out.println(b.size()); // This prints 1!\nb = null;\na = null;\n</code></pre>\n<p>There's only ever <strong>1</strong> list in that snippet, but 2 variables pointing at it, and then at the end, <em>no</em> variables pointing at it. The list is no longer accessible and will get garbage collected at some point, but at the end of that code <em>there is still a list!</em> - it's just no longer possible to refer to it.</p>\n<p>So, what's java writing to? <strong>The file, of course</strong>. It's just that the file <strong>path</strong> on disk that used to point at the file no longer points at it / doesn't even exist anymore.</p>\n<p>On disks systems, a file path is one way to 'get to' a file, but an open handle is another. Java has an open handle. Hence the file continues to exist.</p>\n<p>The disk system is a lot like java's garbage collector, but it just counts references. Once the JVM process exits or closes its handle, the file system driver will mark the space occupied by that file as free immediately (at least, on most file systems).</p>\n<h2>The windows wonkiness</h2>\n<p>Windows is a weird operating system. It essentially works exactly as described above, but old timey file systems used many decades ago on windows worked differently and windows half-bakedly emulates old behaviour, I think even to this day. You cannot delete a filepath on windows normally if a process has a file handle open to the same file the path is pointing to. But, you can make those 'links' on windows too (with the <code>fsutil.exe</code> tool) and I <em>think</em> as long as at least one such filepointer points at it, windows <em>does</em> let you remove the file. Backup tools make such duplicate pointers all the time (because the operation is very fast and it allows snapshot backupping which is nice). Windows also <em>does</em> allow you to <em>rename</em> a file even when there are open handles, though.</p>\n<h2>To answer your question</h2>\n<p>You.. really don't. In the sense that &quot;I want my writing process to abort with an exception if the user of the system decides to mess with a filepath entry that so happens to point at the same file I'm writing to&quot; is just a weird thing to want. The user is deleting it, they know what they are doing, don't second guess them. If you are using it as a 'signal' (i.e. you write in your documentation something like: &quot;This process will start writing a log file. If you wish to stop the process from logging, simply delete the log file&quot; - then find another way for the user to communicate with your app, such as with a frontend of some sort).</p>\n<h2>If you must...</h2>\n<p>Call <code>Files.exists(p)</code> on your path. This is a crappy way to do it; you can't call that continuously; you call it from time to time, of course. In between 2 such calls I could rename the filepath, create a new filepath with the same name that is now a completely different file and not the one your java process is writing to, and then delete the renamed one, and your <code>Files.exists</code> detection scheme wouldn't trigger.</p>\n<p>In fact, in java it is essentially not possible to do what you want in a way that isn't circumventable. There's file watchers but you really don't want to do that, I don't think.</p>\n"
