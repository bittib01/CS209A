    "body": "<p>When I try opening <a href=\"http://www.eclipse.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eclipse</a>, a pop-up dialog states:</p>\n<p><code>Failed to load the JNI shared library &quot;C:/JDK/bin/client/jvm.dll&quot;</code>.</p>\n<p>Following this, Eclipse force closes.</p>\n<p>Here are a few points I'd like to make:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I checked to see if anything exists on that path. It does exist.</li>\n<li>My Eclipse and <a href=\"http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Java SE Development Kit</a> are both 64-bit. I checked my system, and it can handle 64-bit.</li>\n<li>I've searched for this problem on Google and StackOverflow, and the only answer I found was to download the 32-bit versions of JDK and Eclipse.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Downloading the 32-bit versions is something I only want to do as a very last resort.<br />\nWhat would be suggested to solve this issue?</p>\n"
