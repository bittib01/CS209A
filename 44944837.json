    "body": "<p>For a while I have been struggling with creating a control-flow graph with <a href=\"https://sable.github.io/soot/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soot</a> and I kinda got lost in its <a href=\"https://github.com/Sable/soot/wiki/Tutorials\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">tutorials</a>. Rather than using Soot as an Eclipse plugin, I have been trying to use Soot as a library or API. </p>\n\n<p>What I want to do is, I have a bunch of Java projects and I want to create/generate a control-flow graph of these projects. I also saw that there is a feature in Soot that I can generate control-flow graphs in \"DOT\" format, which is quite acceptable for me as well.</p>\n\n<p>Any guide or sample of code that shows how to create/generate a control-flow graph with Soot would be great!</p>\n"
