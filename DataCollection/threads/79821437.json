    "title": "How can I understand what drains memory in my Java app?",
    "body": "<p>I suspect that my Java app running in tomcat is draining some memory, It is a Spring application with most stateless services and then I think the memory consumption should be low especially while no users are connected.</p>\n<p>Than I would like to deepen a bit of what is using java memory, how can I proceed?<br />\nLet's say that in my code there is an always growing cache/map structure that for some reason the GC doesn't free, how can I get? Is there any way to list the objects by consumption with references to the code source?</p>\n<p>I tried to look into Jstack but it seems it lists all threads and doesn't help with the memory.</p>\n"
