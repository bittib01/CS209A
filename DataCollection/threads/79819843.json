    "body": "<p>I have &quot;simple&quot; Junit5 Test which I would like to run with Weld.\nThe test fails, because observer method is invoked on other instance of test class as the one which was started. Even thou I marked the Test class as a @Singleton. Any idea why is that so?</p>\n<p>Thank you\nDalibor</p>\n<pre><code>@EnableWeld\n@Singleton\npublic class EventsTest {\n\n    @WeldSetup\n    WeldInitiator weld = WeldInitiator.performDefaultDiscovery();\n\n    private Address address;\n\n    public void onFixtureBeanConfigured(@Observes final FixtureBeanConfigured beanConfigured) {\n        if (beanConfigured.getFixtureBean() instanceof Address) {\n            this.address = (Address) beanConfigured.getFixtureBean();\n        }\n    }\n\n    @Test\n    public void testFixtureBeanConfiguredEvent() {\n        assertNull(address);\n        addressFixtureObject.get();\n        assertNotNull(address);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n"
