    "body": "<p>I am having a lot of trouble finding good information on how to call a standard SOAP/WSDL web service with Android. All I've been able to find are either very convoluted documents and references to \"kSoap2\" and then some bit about parsing it all manually with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_API_for_XML\" rel=\"noreferrer\">SAX</a>. OK, that's fine, but it's 2008, so I figured there should be some good library for calling standard web services.</p>\n\n<p>The web service is just basically one created in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetBeans\" rel=\"noreferrer\">NetBeans</a>. I would like to have IDE support for generating the plumbing classes. I just need the easiest/most-elegant way to contact a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Services_Description_Language\" rel=\"noreferrer\">WSDL</a> based web service from an Android-based phone.</p>\n"
