      "body": "<p>You can of course give the JVM executable sudo rights (either explicitly, or by running <code>sudo java -jar myapp.jar</code>) but this is <strong>terrible</strong> security design, don't do that.</p>\n<p>Instead, whatever you are trying to execute with <code>Runtime.getRuntime().exec</code> (sidenote: you should probably use <code>ProcessBuilder</code> instead), give <em>that</em> sudo rights. You have 2 options:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Put all that in a shell script, then save it such that only the privileged user (root, or something in the systemd-journal group, see below) can edit it, but the java process user can see it. Give it the SUID flag, and now your non-root-access java app can invoke it and it will 'sudo' itself automatically. Be very careful with this script. For example, if it takes parameters, be real, <em>real</em> careful that some creative hacking about with the parameters doesn't open a door to arbitrary execution. The easiest way to ensure this can't happen is for it to have no parameters. Make more scripts if you must.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Have the java process invoke <code>sudo</code>, and give the user that invokes the JVM passwordless sudo rights. This still means any compromise of the JVM process is an instant root level security breach (as in: Total loss, server is instantly and completely p0wned, and the hacker will wipe all records of how they did it). Far less secure than the first option.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Separately, doublecheck if <code>root</code> is the only way; often there's a privileged group, and any user in that group can do the act. For example, as user @Dai mentioned, if you want to run coredumpctl, you don't need to be root, you simply need to be a user with core dump rights. Depending on your unix distro and setup, there's usually a group defined to be able to do it, such as <code>systemd-journal</code>. <code>sudo</code> does not mean 'run as root', it means 'run as a user I want', and it merely defaults to root. You can use the suid trick as non-root just the same (a user with the privilege makes the shell script and sets the suid flag, and makes sure the user that runs the java process can see the script but not edit it), and you can give the java process sudo rights to sudo into such a user and not a root user (<code>sudo -u</code> for example).</p>\n"
