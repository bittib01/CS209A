    "title": "Feature-Toggle for Spring components",
    "body": "<p>I have a Spring Boot application with a lot of @Component, @Controller, @RestController annotated components. There are about 20 different features which I would like to toggle separatly. It is important that features can be toggled without rebuilding the project (a restart would be ok). I think Spring configuration would be a nice way.</p>\n\n<p>I could image a config (yml) like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>myApplication:\n  features:\n    feature1: true\n    feature2: false\n    featureX: ...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The main problem is that I don't want to use if-blocks in all places. I would prefer to disable the components completely. For example a @RestController should even be loaded and it should not register its pathes. I'm currently searching for something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@Component\n@EnabledIf(\"myApplication.features.feature1\")  // &lt;- something like this\npublic class Feature1{\n   // ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Is there a feature like this? Is there an easy way to implement it myself? Or is there another best practice for feature toggles?</p>\n\n<p>Btw: Spring Boot Version: 1.3.4</p>\n"
