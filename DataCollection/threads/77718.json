Is the reason arbitrary, or lost to time?</p>\n"

      "body": "<p>Some people say that operator overloading in Java would lead to obsfuscation. Have those people ever stopped to look at some Java code doing some basic maths like increasing a financial value by a percentage using BigDecimal ? .... the verbosity of such an exercise becomes its own demonstration of obsfuscation. Ironically, adding operator overloading to Java would allow us to create our own Currency class which would make such mathematical code elegant and simple (less obsfuscated).</p>\n<p>It would be awesome to be able to create a Financial class or Complex number class and use simple +, -, /, * operators on their instances ... like I could in C++ way back in 1999!</p>\n<p>It's now 2024 but &quot;Tonight I want to code like it's nineteen ninety nine...&quot;</p>\n"

      "body": "<p>Part of the reason they decided not to include operator overloading is to keep the language small. I used to love C++, but it was a huge language, which meant there was a lot to learn. And you had to learn the whole thing to be able to maintain a project, especially one you didn't write. And learning C++ means learning about its quirks. But the bigger the language, the more quirks there are. And C++ was a very quirky language. So we not only had to learn all the features of the language, we had to learn them well, to learn their quirks. The developers of Java wisely (in my view) decided to keep the language small. The also eliminated a lot of the features that made the language quirky. This makes Java easy to learn, which means we can start being productive pretty quickly. I really appreciate that.</p>\n<p>One quirky aspect of operator overloading was it led to unreadable code. Imagine if, in English, a novelist decided to redefine certain words. And gave them meanings that were so different from their original meaning that it wouldn't be obvious what the meaning was. Would that make the book hard to read? You bet it would. (In &quot;A Clockwork Orange,&quot; the meaning of the slang that the author invented could usually be discerned from the context, but even with that, it made the book harder to read.) That's what James Gosling was referring to when he spoke of how the feature was abused. It can make the code very hard to maintain, because it's not always clear what the operators mean.</p>\n"
