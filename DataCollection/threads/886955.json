    "title": "How do I break out of nested loops in Java?",
    "body": "<p>I've got a nested loop construct like this:</p>\n<pre><code>for (Type type : types) {\n    for (Type t : types2) {\n         if (some condition) {\n             // Do something and break...\n             break; // Breaks out of the inner loop\n         }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now how can I break out of both loops? I've looked at similar questions, but none concerns Java specifically. I couldn't apply these solutions because most used gotos.</p>\n<p>I don't want to put the inner loop in a different method.</p>\n<p>I don't want to return the loops. When breaking I'm finished with the execution of the loop block.</p>\n"
