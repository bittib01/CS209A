    "body": "<p>I have a Map which is to be modified by several threads concurrently. </p>\n\n<p>There seem to be three different synchronized Map implementations in the Java API:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>Hashtable</code></li>\n<li><code>Collections.synchronizedMap(Map)</code></li>\n<li><code>ConcurrentHashMap</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>From what I understand, <code>Hashtable</code> is an old implementation (extending the obsolete <code>Dictionary</code> class), which has been adapted later to fit the <code>Map</code> interface. While it <em>is</em> synchronized, it seems to have serious <a href=\"http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-jtp07233.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">scalability issues</a> and is discouraged for new projects.</p>\n\n<p>But what about the other two? What are the differences between Maps returned by <code>Collections.synchronizedMap(Map)</code> and <code>ConcurrentHashMap</code>s? Which one fits which situation?</p>\n"
