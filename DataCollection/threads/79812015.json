The <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/reflect/AccessibleObject.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">documentation</a> says that &quot;reflected objects assume readability&quot;.</p>\n<p>If all I am trying to do is read the value of a member field in the Object, does that mean that I can safely assume that I do have &quot;read&quot; access and do not need to call the <code>setAccessible()</code> method?</p>\n"
