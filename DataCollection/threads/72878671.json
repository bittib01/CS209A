    "body": "<p>I am developing an AI Voice assistant using python. I made an app using kivy to connect with my ai using python sockets. I can control my mobile phone using the AI. But, when the application goes to sleep or closed. My app client is not listening for any commands from AI. Is there a way to create a foreground service and add my listener to it.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> The listener will get commands from AI Server and execute it. Eg: opening other applications.</p>\n"
