    "body": "<p>Which of the following is better practice in Java 8?</p>\n\n<p>Java 8:</p>\n\n<pre><code>joins.forEach(join -&gt; mIrc.join(mSession, join));\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Java 7:</p>\n\n<pre><code>for (String join : joins) {\n    mIrc.join(mSession, join);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I have lots of for loops that could be \"simplified\" with lambdas, but is there really any advantage of using them? Would it improve their performance and readability?</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>\n\n<p>I'll also extend this question to longer methods. I know that you can't return or break the parent function from a lambda and this should also be taken into consideration when comparing them, but is there anything else to be considered?</p>\n"
