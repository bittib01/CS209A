      "body": "<p>The <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-8.html#jls-8.3.1.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>static</code> modifier</a> on a field means that that field is shared by the entire class, not just specific instances. Without <code>static</code>, the field is part of <em>instances</em> of the class (created with <code>new</code>).</p>\n<p>Your <code>main</code> method, also <code>static</code>, is run without any instance of the class. So it has access to class fields (aka &quot;class variables&quot;) declared with <code>static</code>, but since it doesn't have an instance, it can't access instance fields (aka &quot;instance variables&quot;).</p>\n<p><code>Test test = new Test();</code> creates an instance, which you're referencing from the <code>test</code> variable. That instance has a field, <code>x</code>, and so you can access it.</p>\n<p>In terms of memory allocation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Memory for the class and various other classes will be allocated by the JVM when starting up your program so it can call <code>main</code> (allocating memory for the <code>Test</code> class includes a small bit for <code>y</code>).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Within <code>main</code>, you're allocating memory for an instance of <code>Test</code> via <code>new Test</code> (which includes a small bit of memory for <code>x</code>).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n"
