    "body": "<p>I want to know what actually happens when you annotate a method with <code>@Transactional</code>?\nOf course, I know that Spring will wrap that method in a Transaction.</p>\n\n<p>But, I have the following doubts:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>I heard that Spring creates a <strong>proxy class</strong>? Can someone explain this in more <strong>depth</strong>. <strong>What actually resides in that proxy class? What happens to the actual class? And how can I see Spring's created proxied class</strong> </li>\n<li>I also read in Spring docs that: </li>\n</ol>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Note: Since this mechanism is based on proxies, <strong>only 'external' method calls coming in through the proxy will be intercepted</strong>.  This means that 'self-invocation', i.e. a method within the target object calling some other method of the target object, won't lead to an actual transaction at runtime even if the invoked method is marked with <code>@Transactional</code>!</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/2.0.x/reference/transaction.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/2.0.x/reference/transaction.html</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Why only external method calls will be under Transaction and not the self-invocation methods?</strong></p>\n"
