    "body": "<p>What is appropriate way to integrate SpringSecurity with Capcha ? </p>\n\n<p>I have following use case :\nWhen user will tries to login, if we he failed to login N times, captcha will be displayed, so authentication will be using three parameters : username, password, captcha. But Spring Security doesn't support built in Captcha handling. </p>\n\n<p>I just start thinking about implementation. And have following variants:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Adding separate security filter in Spring Security filter stack, </li>\n<li>Entirely rewrite AuthenticationProcessingFilter to support some Captcha</li>\n<li>Use some programmatic authentication with interception captcha logic and then transfering username and password to Spring Security</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As a Captcha implementation I think about JCaptcha, but what your thougths?</p>\n"

You can just add a security filter before a <code>UsernamePasswordFilter</code> where you check the user input and how likely they are to be a user. It's normally a percentage for which you have to set a threshold yourself.</p>\n"
