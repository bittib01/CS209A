This needs to be an ordered list and I have to be able to sort on how they are related, input new contacts, and perform various other functions from a menu including sort birthday.  I am having trouble with reading the date from the file which is in format 12/02/1999, and returning month, day, year as three separate things -removing the slashes in between the  month day and year . I am required to have all three separate.  I have tried numerous things, but cannot get anything to work.  Here is my code for three of the six classes in my program that use this date...  My problem is in the class AddressBook when I am reading in the file it breaks when I get to try to read in birthday date  not sure how to read this in and store</p>\n<p>First class is Date: //I am required to have it set up this way though variables can be int or string\n//think I'd rather int but no big deal either way\npublic class Date\n{\nprivate String dMonth;\nprivate String dDay;\nprivate String dYear;\n//private String bday;  try..</p>\n<pre><code>public Date()\n    {\n    \ndMonth = &quot;&quot;;\ndDay = &quot;&quot;;\ndYear = &quot;&quot;;\n}\n\npublic Date(String month, String day, String year)\n{   \ndMonth = month;\ndDay = day;\ndYear = year;\n}\n\npublic void setDate(String month, String day, String year)//had to add void..\n{   \ndMonth = month;\ndDay = day;\ndYear = year;\n}\n\n   public String getMonth()\n{   \nreturn dMonth;\n\n}\n   public String getDate()\n{   \nreturn dDay;\n\n}\n   public String getYear()\n{   \nreturn dYear;\n\n}\n\n   public String getDate(String month, String day, String year)\n{\nreturn (dMonth + &quot;-&quot; +dDay + &quot;-&quot; +dYear);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>Next class is ExtPerson....</p>\n<pre><code> //THIS CLASS EXTENDS PERSON,DATE,ADDRESS\n\n  public class ExtPerson \n\n  {\nprivate Person name;\nprivate Date bDay; \nprivate Address address;\nprivate String relationship;\n      \npublic ExtPerson()\n      {\nname= new Person ();\nbDay = new Date();\naddress = new Address();\nrelationship = &quot;&quot;;\n }\n\npublic ExtPerson(String last, String first, String month, String day, String\n      year, String street, String city, String state, String zipcode, String phone, String\n      relateby)\n      {\n        \nname= new Person (first, last);\nbDay = new Date(month, day, year);\naddress = new Address (street, city,state,zipcode,phone);\nrelationship = relateby;\n    \n      }\n\n     //methd to set personal info. instance variables are set according to parameters\n\n\n     public void setMemberInfo(String last, String first, String month, String day, String \n     year, String street, String city, String state, String zipcode, String phone,String \n     relateby)\n{\n    name.setName(last, first);\n    bDay.setDate(month, day, year);\n    address.setAddress(street, city,state,zipcode,phone);\n    relationship = relateby;\n }\n\npublic void setRelationship(String relateby)\n{\n    relationship = relateby;\n}\n\npublic boolean isRelationship(String relateby)\n{\n    return (relationship.equals(relateby));\n}\n\npublic String getRelationship()\n{\n    return relationship;\n}\npublic Person getMembername()\n{\n    return name;\n}\npublic void printRelationship()\n{\n    System.out.println(&quot;Relationship: &quot; + relationship);\n}\n\npublic void printInfo()\n{\n    System.out.println (&quot;Name: &quot; + name.toString()); \n    System.out.println (&quot;Date of birth: &quot; + bDay.toString ());\n    System.out.println (&quot;Address: &quot; + address.toString()); \n    System.out.println (&quot;Relationship: &quot; + relationship.toString());\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>And last class AddressBook where I read all these name into using a filereader: THIS IS WHERE ERROR COMES WHEN GET TO BIRTHDAY</p>\n<pre><code> import java.io.*;\n import java.util.*;\n\n public class AddressBook\n {\n int nMembers;//in the beginning of infile, there is an int that says how many people are \n                      in the file\n ExtPerson[] bookMembers = new ExtPerson[500];\n    \n\n public AddressBook(Scanner inFile )\n {\n    String last, first, street, city, state, zipcode,phone, relateby;\n    String month,day,year;\n    //int month, day, year;  not sure if I'm better off with int or string for \n                           these..\n\n            \n    nMembers = inFile.nextInt();\n    inFile.nextLine(); //discard the newline character\n    \n        \n    for (int index = 0; index &lt; nMembers; index++)\n    {\n        bookMembers[index] = new ExtPerson();\n        \n        first =  inFile.next();\n        last =  inFile.next();\n\n\n                  //HERE IS MY PROBLEM..
