    "title": "&#39;Must Override a Superclass Method&#39; Errors after importing a project into Eclipse",
    "body": "<p>Anytime I have to re-import my projects into Eclipse (if I reinstalled Eclipse, or changed the location of the projects), <strong>almost all</strong> of my overridden methods are not formatted correctly, causing the error:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The method must override a superclass method</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It may be noteworthy to mention this is with Android projects for whatever reason, the method argument values are not always populated, so I have to manually populate them myself. For instance:</p>\n\n<pre><code>list.setOnCreateContextMenuListener(new OnCreateContextMenuListener() {\n\n    //These arguments have their correct names\n    public void onCreateContextMenu(ContextMenu menu, View v, \n                                    ContextMenuInfo menuInfo) {                 \n    }\n\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>will be initially populated like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>list.setOnCreateContextMenuListener(new OnCreateContextMenuListener() {\n\n    //This methods arguments were not automatically provided    \n    public void onCreateContextMenu(ContextMenu arg1, View arg2,\n                                    ContextMenuInfo arg3) {\n    }\n\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The odd thing is, if I remove my code, and have Eclipse automatically recreate the method, it uses the same argument names I already had, so I don't really know where the problem is, other then it auto-formatting the method for me.</p>\n\n<p>This becomes quite a pain having to manually recreate ALL my overridden methods by hand. If anyone can explain why this happens or how to fix it. I would be very happy.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe it is due to the way I am formatting the methods, which are inside an argument of another method?</p>\n"
