    "title": "What&#39;s the difference between JPA and Hibernate?",
    "body": "<p>I understand that JPA 2 is a specification and Hibernate is a tool for ORM. Also, I understand that Hibernate has more features than JPA 2. But from a practical point of view, what really is the difference? </p>\n\n<p>I have experience using iBatis and now I'm trying to learn either Hibernate or JPA2. I picked up Pro JPA2 book and it keeps referring to \"JPA provider\". For example:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If you think a feature should be standardized, you should speak up\n  and request it from your JPA provider</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This confuses me so I have a few questions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Using JPA2 alone can I fetch data from DB by simply annotating my POJO's</li>\n<li>Is JPA2 supposed to be used with a \"JPA Provider\" e.g TopLink or Hibernate? If so, then what's the benefit of using JPA2 + Hibernate as compared to JPA2 alone, or compared to Hibernate alone ?</li>\n<li>Can you recommend a good practical JPA2 book. \"Pro JPA2\" seems more like a bible and reference on JPA2 (It doesn't get into Queries until the later half of the book). Is there a book that takes a problem/solution approach to JPA2?</li>\n</ul>\n"
