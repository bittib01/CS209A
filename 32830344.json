    "body": "<p>Question first, then backstory, as to not make the question seem completely idiotic if it is in fact not possible.</p>\n<p>QUESTION: Is there any way to write a method that returns || or &amp;&amp; or &lt; or &gt; depending on which implemented subclass is calling the method</p>\n<p>I'm currently learning Java and taking a few courses at uni to that extent.</p>\n<p>So in an assignment in a course concerning objective-based design patterns and discrete structures we are to write a program that simulates a logical proposition and examines it for the quality of tautologi. i.e. if the expression is true for all possible inputs.</p>\n<p>I have made a simple binarytree implementation and the program works, but the design part of the course calls for us to use such design patterns as &quot;Composite&quot; and &quot;Template method&quot; all very fashionable words, sure you´ve all heard of e´m.</p>\n<p>I have a Template method pattern in my toString insothat the</p>\n<pre><code>abstract Class BinaryConnector extends Expression{\nprotected Expression a,b\npublic String toString(){return a + getConnective() + b;  }\npublic abstract String getConnective();\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>which in for example</p>\n<pre><code>Class Or extends BinaryConnective{\n//omissions\npublic String getConnective(){return &quot;||&quot;;}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I would like to do the same for the actual comparison as well.</p>\n<p>I suppose there are many ways of jury-rigging such a solution, such as a switch-statement in my abstract class. But just elegant solutions please. I'm hoping for something like&quot; just parse the getConnective()&quot; or similar</p>\n<p>or scold me for making you read so much.</p>\n"
