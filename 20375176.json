    "title": "Should I always use a parallel stream when possible?",
    "body": "<p>With Java 8 and lambdas it's easy to iterate over collections as streams, and just as easy to use a parallel stream. Two examples from <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/interfaces/collection.html\">the docs</a>, the second one using parallelStream:</p>\n\n<pre><code>myShapesCollection.stream()\n    .filter(e -&gt; e.getColor() == Color.RED)\n    .forEach(e -&gt; System.out.println(e.getName()));\n\nmyShapesCollection.parallelStream() // &lt;-- This one uses parallel\n    .filter(e -&gt; e.getColor() == Color.RED)\n    .forEach(e -&gt; System.out.println(e.getName()));\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As long as I don't care about the order, would it always be beneficial to use the parallel? One would think it is faster dividing the work on more cores.</p>\n\n<p>Are there other considerations? When should parallel stream be used and when should the non-parallel be used?</p>\n\n<p><sup>(This question is asked to trigger a discussion about how and when to use parallel streams, not because I think always using them is a good idea.)</sup></p>\n"
