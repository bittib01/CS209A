      "body": "<h3>0. Is there any difference between these errors?</h3>\n<p>Not really. &quot;Cannot find symbol&quot;, &quot;Cannot resolve symbol&quot; and &quot;Symbol not found&quot; all mean the same thing.  (Different Java compilers are written by different people, and different people use different phraseology to say the same thing.)</p>\n<h3>1. What does a &quot;Cannot find symbol&quot; error mean?</h3>\n<p>Firstly, it is a <em>compilation error</em><sup>1</sup>.  It means that <em>either</em> there is a problem in your Java source code, <em>or</em> there is a problem in the way that you are compiling it.</p>\n<p>Your Java source code consists of the following things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keywords: like <code>class</code>, <code>while</code>, and so on.</li>\n<li>Literals: like <code>true</code>, <code>false</code>, <code>42</code>, <code>'X'</code> and <code>&quot;Hi mum!&quot;</code>.</li>\n<li>Operators and other non-alphanumeric tokens: like <code>+</code>, <code>=</code>, <code>{</code>, and so on.</li>\n<li>Identifiers: like <code>Reader</code>, <code>i</code>, <code>toString</code>, <code>processEquibalancedElephants</code>, and so on.</li>\n<li>Comments and whitespace.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A &quot;Cannot find symbol&quot; error is about the identifiers.  When your code is compiled, the compiler needs to work out what each and every identifier in your code means.</p>\n<p>A &quot;Cannot find symbol&quot; error means that the compiler cannot do this.  Your code appears to be referring to something that the compiler doesn't understand.</p>\n<h3>2. What can cause a &quot;Cannot find symbol&quot; error?</h3>\n<p>As a first order, there is only one cause.  The compiler looked in all of the places where the identifier <em>should</em> be defined, and it couldn't find the definition.  This could be caused by a number of things.  The common ones are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>For identifiers in general:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Perhaps you spelled the name incorrectly; i.e., <code>StringBiulder</code> instead of <code>StringBuilder</code>.  Java cannot and will not attempt to compensate for bad spelling or typing errors.</li>\n<li>Perhaps you got the case wrong; i.e. <code>stringBuilder</code> instead of <code>StringBuilder</code>.  All Java identifiers are case sensitive.</li>\n<li>Perhaps you used underscores inappropriately; i.e., <code>mystring</code> and <code>my_string</code> are different.  (If you stick to the Java style rules, you will be largely protected from this mistake...)</li>\n<li>Perhaps you are trying to use something that was declared &quot;somewhere else&quot;; i.e. in a different context to where you have implicitly told the compiler to look.  (A different class?  A different scope?  A different package?  A different code-base?)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p>For identifiers that should refer to variables:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Perhaps you forgot to declare the variable.</li>\n<li>Perhaps the variable declaration is out of scope at the point you tried to use it.  (See example below)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p>For identifiers that should be method or field names:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Perhaps you are trying to refer to an inherited method or field that wasn't declared in the parent / ancestor classes or interfaces.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Perhaps you are trying to refer to a method or field that does not exist (i.e., has not been declared) in the type you are using; e.g., <code>&quot;rope&quot;.push()</code><sup>2</sup>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Perhaps you are trying to use a method as a field, or vice versa; e.g. <code>&quot;rope&quot;.length</code> or <code>someArray.length()</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Perhaps you are mistakenly operating on an array rather than array element; e.g.,</p>\n<pre><code>    String strings[] = ...\n    if (strings.charAt(3)) { ... }\n    // Maybe that should be 'strings[0].charAt(3)'\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p>For identifiers that should be class names:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Perhaps you forgot to import the class.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Perhaps you used &quot;star&quot; imports, but the class isn't defined in any of the packages that you imported.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Perhaps you forgot a <code>new</code> as in:</p>\n<pre><code>    String s = String();  // Should be 'new String()'\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li><p>Perhaps you are trying to import or otherwise use a class that has been declared in the <em>default package</em>; i.e., the one where classes with no <code>package</code> statements go.</p>\n<p>Hint: learn about packages.  You should only use the default package for simple applications that consist of one class ... or at a stretch, one Java source file.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p>For cases where type or instance doesn't appear to have the member (e.g., method or field) you were expecting it to have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Perhaps you have declared a nested class or a generic parameter that <em>shadows</em> the type you were meaning to use.</li>\n<li>Perhaps you are shadowing a static or instance variable.</li>\n<li>Perhaps you imported the wrong type; e.g., due to IDE completion or auto-correction may have suggested <code>java.awt.List</code> rather than <code>java.util.List</code>.</li>\n<li>Perhaps you are using (compiling against) the wrong version of an API.</li>\n<li>Perhaps you forgot to cast your object to an appropriate subclass.</li>\n<li>Perhaps you have declared the <em>variable's</em> type to be a supertype of the one with the member you are looking for.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The problem is often a combination of the above.  For example, maybe you &quot;star&quot; imported <code>java.io.*</code> and then tried to use the <code>Files</code> class ... which is in <code>java.nio</code> not <code>java.io</code>.  Or maybe you meant to write <code>File</code> ... which <em>is</em> a class in <code>java.io</code>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Here is an example of how incorrect variable scoping can lead to a &quot;Cannot find symbol&quot; error:</p>\n<pre><code>List&lt;String&gt; strings = ...\n\nfor (int i = 0; i &lt; strings.size(); i++) {\n    if (strings.get(i).equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;fnord&quot;)) {\n        break;\n    }\n}\nif (i &lt; strings.size()) {\n    ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will give a &quot;Cannot find symbol&quot; error for <code>i</code> in the <code>if</code> statement.  Though we previously declared <code>i</code>, that declaration is only <em>in scope</em> for the <code>for</code> statement and its body.  The reference to <code>i</code> in the <code>if</code> statement <em>cannot see</em> that declaration of <code>i</code>.  It is <em>out of scope</em>.</p>\n<p>(An appropriate correction here might be to move the <code>if</code> statement inside the loop, or to declare <code>i</code> before the start of the loop.)</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Here is an example that causes puzzlement where a typo leads to a seemingly inexplicable &quot;Cannot find symbol&quot; error:</p>\n<pre><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; 100; i++); {\n    System.out.println(&quot;i is &quot; + i);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will give you a compilation error in the <code>println</code> call saying that <code>i</code> cannot be found.  But (I hear you say) I did declare it!</p>\n<p>The problem is the sneaky semicolon ( <code>;</code> ) before the <code>{</code>.  The Java language syntax defines a semicolon in that context to be an <em>empty statement</em>.  The empty statement then becomes the body of the <code>for</code> loop.  So that code actually means this:</p>\n<pre><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; 100; i++);\n\n// The previous and following are separate statements!!\n\n{\n    System.out.println(&quot;i is &quot; + i);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>{ ... }</code> block is NOT the body of the <code>for</code> loop, and therefore the previous declaration of <code>i</code> in the <code>for</code> statement is <em>out of scope</em> in the block.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Here is another example of &quot;Cannot find symbol&quot; error that is caused by a typo.</p>\n<pre><code>int tmp = ...\nint res = tmp(a + b);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Despite the previous declaration, the <code>tmp</code> in the <code>tmp(...)</code> expression is erroneous.  The compiler will look for a method called <code>tmp</code>, and won't find one.  The previously declared <code>tmp</code> is in the namespace for variables, not the namespace for methods.</p>\n<p>In the example I came across, the programmer had actually left out an operator.  What he meant to write was this:</p>\n<pre><code>int res = tmp * (a + b);\n</code></pre>\n<hr />\n<p>There is another reason why the compiler might not find a symbol if you are compiling from the command line.  You might simply have forgotten to compile or recompile some other class.  For example, if you have classes <code>Foo</code> and <code>Bar</code> where <code>Foo</code> uses <code>Bar</code>.  If you have never compiled <code>Bar</code> and you run <code>javac Foo.java</code>, you are liable to find that the compiler can't find the symbol <code>Bar</code>.  The simple answer is to compile <code>Foo</code> and <code>Bar</code> together; e.g., <code>javac Foo.java Bar.java</code> or <code>javac *.java</code>.  Or better still use a Java build tool; e.g., <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Ant\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ant</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Maven\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Maven</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradle\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Gradle</a> and so on.</p>\n<p>There are some other more obscure causes too ... which I will deal with below.</p>\n<h3>3. How do I fix these errors?</h3>\n<p>Generally speaking, you start out by figuring out what <em>caused</em> the compilation error.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Look at the line in the file indicated by the compilation error message.</li>\n<li>Identify which symbol that the error message is talking about.</li>\n<li>Figure out <em>why</em> the compiler is saying that it cannot find the symbol; see above!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Then you <em>think</em> about what your code is supposed to be saying.  Then finally you work out what correction you need to make to your source code to do what you want.</p>\n<p>Note that not every &quot;correction&quot; is correct. Consider this:</p>\n<pre><code>for (int i = 1; i &lt; 10; i++) {\n    for (j = 1; j &lt; 10; j++) {\n        ...\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Suppose that the compiler says &quot;Cannot find symbol&quot; for <code>j</code>.  There are many ways I could &quot;fix&quot; that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I could change the inner <code>for</code> to <code>for (int j = 1; j &lt; 10; j++)</code> - probably correct.</li>\n<li>I could add a declaration for <code>j</code> <em>before</em> the inner <code>for</code> loop, or the outer <code>for</code> loop - possibly correct.</li>\n<li>I could change <code>j</code> to <code>i</code> in the inner <code>for</code> loop - probably wrong!</li>\n<li>and so on.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The point is that you <em>need</em> to understand what your code is trying to do in order to find the right fix.</p>\n<h3>4. Obscure causes</h3>\n<p>Here are a couple of cases where the &quot;Cannot find symbol&quot; is seemingly inexplicable ... until you look closer.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Incorrect dependencies</strong>: If you are using an IDE or a build tool that manages the build path and project dependencies, you may have made a mistake with the dependencies; e.g., left out a dependency, or selected the wrong version.  If you are using a build tool (Ant, Maven, Gradle, etc), check the project's build file.  If you are using an IDE, check the project's build path configuration.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Cannot find symbol 'var'</strong>: You are probably trying to compile source code that uses local variable type inference (i.e. a <code>var</code> declaration) with an older compiler or older <code>--source</code> level.  The <code>var</code> was introduced in Java 10.  Check your JDK version and your build files, and (if this occurs in an IDE), the IDE settings.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>You are not compiling / recompiling</strong>:  It sometimes happens that new Java programmers don't understand how the Java tool chain works, or haven't implemented a repeatable &quot;build process&quot;; e.g. using an IDE, Ant, Maven, Gradle and so on.  In such a situation, the programmer can end up chasing his tail looking for an illusory error that is <em>actually</em> caused by not recompiling the code properly, and the like.</p>\n<p>Another example of this is when you use (Java 9+) <code>java SomeClass.java</code> to compile and run a class.  If the class depends on another class that you haven't compiled (or recompiled), you are liable to get &quot;Cannot resolve symbol&quot; errors referring to the 2nd class.  The other source file(s) are not automatically compiled.  The <code>java</code> command's new &quot;compile and run&quot; mode is not designed for running programs with multiple source code files.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>An earlier build problem</strong>:  It is possible that an earlier build failed in a way that gave a JAR file with missing classes.  Such a failure would typically be noticed if you were using a build tool.  However if you are getting JAR files from someone else, you are dependent on <em>them</em> building properly, and noticing errors.  If you suspect this, use <code>tar -tvf</code> to list the contents of the suspect JAR file.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>IDE issues</strong>: People have reported cases where their IDE gets confused and the compiler in the IDE cannot find a class that exists ... or the reverse situation.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>This could happen if the IDE has been configured with the wrong JDK version.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>This could happen if the IDE's caches get out of sync with the file system.  There are IDE specific ways to fix that.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>This could be an IDE bug.  For instance @Joel Costigliola described a scenario where Eclipse did not handle a Maven &quot;test&quot; tree correctly: <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/37207223/139985\"><strong>see this answer</strong></a>.  (Apparently that particular bug was been fixed a long time ago.)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Android issues</strong>: When you are programming for Android, and you have &quot;Cannot find symbol&quot; errors related to <code>R</code>, be aware that the <code>R</code> symbols are defined by the <code>context.xml</code> file.  Check that your <code>context.xml</code> file is correct and in the correct place, and that the corresponding <code>R</code> class file has been generated / compiled.  Note that the Java symbols are case sensitive, so the corresponding XML ids are case sensitive too.</p>\n<p>Other symbol errors on Android are likely to be due to previously mention reasons; e.g., missing or incorrect dependencies, incorrect package names, method or fields that don't exist in a particular API version, spelling / typing errors, and so on.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Hiding system classes</strong>: I've seen cases where the compiler complains that <code>substring</code> is an unknown symbol in something like the following</p>\n<pre><code>String s = ...\nString s1 = s.substring(1);\n</code></pre>\n<p>It turned out that the programmer had created their own version of <code>String</code> and that his version of the class didn't define a <code>substring</code> methods.  I've seen people do this with <code>System</code>, <code>Scanner</code> and other classes.</p>\n<p><em>Lesson:</em> Don't define your own classes with the same names as common library classes!</p>\n<p>The problem can also be solved by using the fully qualified names.  For example, in the example above, the programmer <em>could</em> have written:</p>\n<pre><code>java.lang.String s = ...\njava.lang.String s1 = s.substring(1);\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Homoglyphs:</strong>  If you use UTF-8 encoding for your source files, it is possible to have identifiers that <em>look</em> the same, but are in fact different because they contain homoglyphs.   See <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoglyph\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this page</a> for more information.</p>\n<p>You can avoid this by restricting yourself to ASCII or Latin-1 as the source file encoding, and using Java <code>\\uxxxx</code> escapes for other characters.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1 - If, perchance, you <em>do</em> see this in a runtime exception or error message, then either you have configured your IDE to run code with compilation errors, or your application is generating and compiling code .. at runtime. <br />\n2 - The three basic principles of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_engineering\" rel=\"noreferrer\">civil engineering</a>: water doesn't flow uphill, a plank is stronger on its side, and <em>you can't push on a rope</em>.</sup></p>\n"
