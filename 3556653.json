    "body": "<p>As I know many Java EE application servers are written in Java. (JBoss, Tomcat...)</p>\n\n<p>Is Websphere also written in Java? </p>\n\n<p>I found that Websphere's performance is dramatic high, I guess that Websphere is written in C++. I couldn't imagine that the 'heavy' server is able to run so fast in JVM.</p>\n\n<p>Is it true?</p>\n"

      "body": "<p>around 97, initially was written in plain C and Perl (for the Enterprise Java Bean container EJB1 then EJB2).. Not in Java and Not in C++ and Not in PL/1 and Not in Smalltalk. Before being commercialized, v1 and v2 run on RS6000 AIX, and one had to customize the Makefile to compile the product... there is a mix up on the original product name.. some confusion (even on Wiki) as some think it was a continuation of IBM failing product &quot;IBM San Francisco&quot;. Well, it is not... finally, the name &quot;WEBSPHERE&quot; I believe was used as an Apple product early 80's, but there is no trace of it on Google and anywhere else; don't recall if it was a product put by a third company to do backup...</p>\n"
