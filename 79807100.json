    "title": "Android autorestart service after app Cleaner",
    "body": "<p>I have an app (graphics + service), and they work perfectly. When the app starts, the service and graphics start. After a phone reboot, the service starts again. However, there's one problem: if I run the Cleaner app, the service is killed and doesn't start again until I launch the app manually. Can you tell me how to prevent it from being killed or restart the service? My app is in Kivy + some service components are in Java.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/v8UAACGo.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/v8UAACGo.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>I have found how to do it in settings (<strong>Settings-&gt;Applications-&gt;Autostart in background</strong>), but how create it in code when I install\\start my app.\nThe same telegram\\whatsapp are added here themselves.</p>\n<p><strong>Автозапуск в фоновом режиме</strong> == <strong>Autostart in background</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ozWtXxA4.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ozWtXxA4.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n"
