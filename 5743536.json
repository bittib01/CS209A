    "title": "Lazy Class Definition",
    "body": "<p>What would be a quantifiable definition of a lazy class (i.e. a class that does too little)? How little methods would a class need to have to qualify as lazy in your opinion? Would a class that only has a constructor, getters and setters qualify as lazy? Or would that count as a data-class?</p>\n\n<p>I understand there are no hard-and-fast rules when it comes to this stuff, but I would be curious to hear different peoples opinions.</p>\n"

      "body": "<p>Some believe that a data class (just getters and setters) is a code smell, and it could be, but a data class can be easily justified by using it to counter another smell called <a href=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/code-smells/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">primitive obsession</a>. (The referenced Coding Horror article actually refers to both types of smells.)</p>\n<p>There are no hard and fast rules. But a small, or lazy class, is better, <strong>always</strong>, than a class that does too much. Use the right class for the right job keeping in mind <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">DRY</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">SRP</a> first. If a &quot;lazy&quot; class fits, use it. I also find that if I end up with a lazy class it's pretty easy to refactor it and combine it with &quot;more useful&quot; code. It's much easier to do that than to try and break up an &quot;eager&quot;, too-large-a-class later.</p>\n"
