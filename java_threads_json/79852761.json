    "title": "Java Swing automation with Squish works for simple flows but fails on deeper navigation",
    "body": "<p>I’m automating a Linux-based Java Swing application using <strong>Squish for Java 9.1.1</strong> on a VirtualBox VM. Automation works for simple flows, but after navigating 3–4 pages the app intermittently shows a grey/blank screen, redirects to home, or stops responding—while manual runs work fine. Are there known Squish issues or best practices for handling deeper/dynamic UI flows in Java Swing applications?</p>\n"
