    "body": "<p>This is one of those error messages that comes up a lot, but none of the question/answers address this particular situation.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I am creating a runnable jar from the contents of an Eclipse project.</li>\n<li>When I use the Eclipse IDE to create a runnable jar, it works.</li>\n<li>When I\nuse <code>java.util.zip.*</code> functions to create the runnable jar, it does\n<strong>not</strong> work.</li>\n<li>When I compare the two files in Windows explorer they are identical.</li>\n<li>When I extract the zip files and compare the resulting contents on disk (Using WinMerge), they are identical.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Why would one file work, and the other, seemingly identical file not work?</p>\n<p>Here's a snip of the code that I'm using.  Not the full implementation, just the interesting bit:</p>\n<pre><code>    ZipInputStream zin = new ZipInputStream(new FileInputStream(tempFile));\n    ZipOutputStream out = new ZipOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(zipFile));\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; fileList.length; i++) {\n        InputStream in = new FileInputStream(fileList[i]);\n        String absoluteFileNameString = fileList[i].getAbsolutePath();\n        if (baseDirectory != null &amp;&amp; baseDirectory.length() &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; absoluteFileNameString.length() &gt; (baseDirectory.length() + 1) ) {\n            absoluteFileNameString = absoluteFileNameString.substring(baseDirectory.length() + 1);\n        }\n        out.putNextEntry(new ZipEntry(absoluteFileNameString));\n        int len;\n        while ((len = in.read(buf)) &gt; 0) {\n            out.write(buf, 0, len);\n        }\n        out.closeEntry();\n        in.close();\n    }\n    out.close();\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here is the output showing that one works and the other doesn't:</p>\n<pre><code>C:\\Users\\Owner\\git\\runnablejarbuilder\\RunnableJarBuilder&gt;java -jar RunnableJarBuilder.zip\nError: Could not find or load main class com.rjb.test.HelloRun\nCaused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com.rjb.test.HelloRun\n\nC:\\Users\\Owner\\git\\runnablejarbuilder\\RunnableJarBuilder&gt;java -jar RunnableJarBuilderIDE.zip\nHello Runnable Jar!\n</code></pre>\n<p>Below is a screen shot (the only way to capture what Windows explorer was telling me: the files were exactly duplicates of each other):</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/yrAa79E0.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/yrAa79E0.png\" alt=\"jar files expanded by Windows explorer show as identical and windows command prompt shows one works and other does not\" /></a></p>\n"
