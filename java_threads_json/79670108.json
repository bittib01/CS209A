    "title": "Most appropriate PromQL function and corresponding panel type on grafana for methods with @Timed",
    "body": "<p>I am using @Timed from micrometer-core on a few methods to capture the response time of methods in a very simple way like this - <code>@Timed(percentiles = {0.50, 0.95, 0.99, 0.999})</code>\nIt is a spring-boot project where I am doing this. Next, I am trying to have a visualization for this metric on grafana. I haven't been able to find what would be an appropriate PromQL function and corresponding panel that I should using.\nSo, far I have used the following function with a time-series panel:</p>\n<pre><code>avg_over_time(method_timed_seconds{method=&quot;methodA&quot;,quantile=~&quot;0.5|0.95|0.99|0.999&quot;}[$__range])\n</code></pre>\n<p>I request for any suggestions on what could be possible functions and visualization. Additionally, I see that @Timed exposes another metric - <code>method_timed_seconds_sum</code>. I am struggling to find the appropriate method and visualization for this metric as well. Any suggestion will help me. Thanks !</p>\n"
