    "title": "How can I shuffle an array using a seeded randomiser?",
    "body": "<p>I must prompt for a number range and seed, then create an array of 5 numbers per row that has 2 of each number within the given range, in ASCENDING order. Following this, the order should be shuffled using a seeded randomiser, until all original values have been used.</p>\n<p>EDIT (instructions I was given for specifically the last for loop):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>SEED A RANDOMISER</li>\n<li>ITERATE OVER THE COLLECTION UNTIL ALL NUMBERS ARE USED</li>\n<li>RETRIEVE A RANDOM NUMBER TO BE USED AS AN INDEX TO TAKE A VALUE FROM ORIGINAL COLLECTION</li>\n<li>IF NUMBER DOES NOT EQUAL ZERO PRINT AND MAKE IT EQUAL ZERO</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is the last step in my code but I still receive duplicates of collection values.</p>\n<p>I have managed to print the array both times succesfully, however the shuffled values don't match the order given in the Zybooks answers. I assume its something with nextInt but I can't figure out what, as I receive duplicates of the same numbers.\nFor those wondering how there can be a set answer, it is because the randomiser is using a seed, meaning the same seed should yield the same results.</p>\n<pre><code>import java.util.Random;\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class LabProgram {\n   public static void main(String[] args) {\n      Scanner scnr = new Scanner(System.in);System.out.println(&quot;Please enter the number of elements to be paired.&quot;);\n      System.out.println();\n      int numPairs = scnr.nextInt();\n      \n      int[] board = new int[numPairs * 2];\n      \n      // populate the board\n      int num = 1;\n      for (int i = 0; i &lt; board.length; i+= 2) {\n         board[i] = num;\n         board[i + 1] = num;\n         num++;\n      }\n      \n      //print initial pairs\n      \n      for (int i = 0; i &lt; board.length; i++) {\n         System.out.printf(&quot;%4d&quot;, board[i]);\n         if ((i + 1) % 5 == 0 || board.length - 1 == i) { \n            System.out.println();\n         }\n      }\n      \n      System.out.println();\n      \n      System.out.println(&quot;Please enter a seed number for testing purposes.&quot;);\n      System.out.println();\n      //SEED a randomiser for testing purposes (use the Random class for this).\n      int seed = scnr.nextInt();\n     \n      Random random = new Random();\n      random.setSeed(seed);\n      \n      int remainingElements = board.length;\n      for (int i = 0; i &lt; board.length; i++) {\n         board[i] = random.nextInt(numPairs) + 1;\n         \n         if (board[i] != 0) {\n            System.out.printf(&quot;%4d&quot;, board[i]);\n            if ((i + 1) % 5 == 0 || board.length - 1 == i) {   \n               System.out.println();\n               board[i] = 0;\n            }\n         }\n      }\n   }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I am testing with values 5 and 22, 5 being the number of pairs and 22 being the seed. Expected result is (2 1 1 5 3 4 2 4 3 5), what I receive currently is (4 4 5 3 2 1 3 5 1), again using 5 and 22 as input values. What confuses me most is how I can still receive duplicate numbers despite the <code>if (board[i] != 0)</code> part..</p>\n"
