    "title": "Is it necessary to verify if the related @ManyToOne entity exists before saving the parent entity in JPA",
    "body": "<p>For example, when an entity Person which has a @ManyToOne relationship to Company (not cascade) is received for saving, should I manually call companyService.findById() to check that it exists before saving the Person entity?</p>\n<p>It is just a matter of protection because if I do not check it and the company does not exists, the person entity will not be persisted (at least in my tests)</p>\n<p>What's the best practice for this? I would like to avoid always fetching before saving, and even more if it is a bulk create of persons where the Person entity contains multiple Many to One relationships.</p>\n<p>I leave you a simple piece of code.</p>\n<pre><code>@Data\n@Entity\n@Table(name = &quot;person&quot;)\npublic class PersonEntity{\n\n    @Id\n    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.UUID)\n    private UUID uuid;\n\n    private String name;\n\n    @ManyToOne\n    @JoinColumn(name = &quot;company_id&quot;)\n    private CompanyEntity company;\n\n    @ManyToOne\n    @JoinColumn(name = &quot;other_entity_id&quot;)\n    private OtherEntity otherEntity;\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n"
