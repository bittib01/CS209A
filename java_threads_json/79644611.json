    "title": "What does it mean that the Jakarta EE Platform specification adds support for a specific Java SE runtime?",
    "body": "<p>The <a href=\"https://jakarta.ee/specifications/platform/10/jakarta-platform-spec-10.0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Jakarta EE Platform 10 specification</a> states the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The goal of the Jakarta EE 10 release is [...] adding the support for\nthe Java SE 11 and newer runtimes. The TCKs require support for both\nJava SE 11 and Java SE 17.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What does this mean? Specifially, I'm wondering what this means regarding the Java SE version</p>\n<ul>\n<li>in terms of Java SE features used in the Jakarta EE Platform 10 specification (i.e., does it mean that the APIs specified in the specification can only use features which are compatible with both Java SE 11 and Java SE 17)?</li>\n<li>in terms of Java SE features being available for implementing the Jakarta EE Platform 10 specification (i.e., features of which Java SE version can vendors of application servers use?)</li>\n<li>required to run an application server which implements the Jakarta EE Platform 10 specification</li>\n<li>in terms of Java SE features being available for implementing applications which are deployed in an application server which implements the Jakarta EE Platform 10</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I guess my understanding in how all of this relates is lacking - it would be great if you could shed some light on this!</p>\n"
