    "title": "Spring LDAP 2 to 3 Migration - Cannot search without binding",
    "body": "<p>I am working on Spring LDAP migration from 2 to 3 in a Java agent running on Windows Active Directory server.</p>\n<p>In one piece of my code I authenticate as Administrator and perform a LDAP search using the token. After the migration, I see the following error:</p>\n<p><code>Caused by: javax.naming.NamingException: [LDAP: error code 1 - 000004DC: LdapErr: DSID-0C090CE5, comment: In order to perform this operation a successful bind must be completed on the connection., data 0, v4563]</code></p>\n<p>Are there some default value changed in the major version upgrade? I struggled to find Spring documentation - <a href=\"https://docs.spring.io/spring-ldap/reference/introduction.html#spring-ldap-new-2.2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">their official doc</a> only mentioned what is new in 2.2 but not the change of 3.</p>\n<p>Any pointers will be appreciated!</p>\n"
