    "body": "<p>I've stumbled upon an old university exercise in which the aim was to reason about <em>what can happen in <strong>absence</strong> of synchronization</em>.</p>\n<p>Consider the following code:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>public class Main {\n    \n    public static void main(String args[]){ \n        Thread t1 = new SimpleThread();\n        Thread t2 = new SimpleThread();\n        t1.start();\n        t2.start();\n    }\n    \n    static class SimpleThread extends Thread {\n        \n        private static volatile int n = 0;\n        \n        public void run() {\n            n++;\n            int m = n;\n            System.out.println(m);\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>What are all the possible outputs for this program and why?</p>\n<p>I've thought of the following scenarios:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>t1 and t2 are executed completely (doesn't matter in which order) and not in parallel so we have <code>1 2</code></li>\n<li>t1 and t2 are executed in parallel, in both threads <code>n++</code> gets executed &quot;correctly&quot; but the scheduler executes first the print for the thread which has <code>m=2</code> so we have <code>2 1</code></li>\n<li>t1 and t2 are executed in parallel and both read <code>n=0</code> in the instruction <code>n++</code> so we have <code>1 1</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Did I get these scenarios right? Is there some scenario I am missing out (e.g. can <code>2 2</code> happen and why)\n?</p>\n"
