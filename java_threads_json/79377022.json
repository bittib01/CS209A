    "body": "<p>I am currently looking at and testing the JobRunR library. I have now been able to start a job and read out the status. Everything actually looks very good. But now there are also jobs that produce a return. How can I get this value again?</p>\n<p>Can anyone give me a tip on how to solve this?</p>\n<p>Example Job start:</p>\n<pre><code>JobId jobId = BackgroundJob.enqueue(() -&gt; String result = this.controller.generatePreview(date));\n</code></pre>\n<p>I need <code>result</code></p>\n"
