    "body": "<p>I've created an application with an external dependency that registers WABs. The WABs are created with a manifest.mf that contains the desired Web-ContextPath: '/custom/route' configuration. This works to register a new context and serve it's contents on that path. However with the move from pax web 7 to 8 that new context that's created now creates pathing conflicts with servlets under the same base URI. example servlet under /custom/route/myservlet can never be reached because the path match will grab the /custom/route context and my servlet isn't registered to that context. Those outside dependencies can change their path and I'd prefer to not have to register to those outside contexts. I've tried creating my own context to match i.e. create a new servletcontexthelper with the path /custom/route but then my servlets cannot be found ( presumably the precedence of the context created by the WAB wins out ).</p>\n<p>So I've tried a lot of different solution at this point but they all don't work for one reason or another.</p>\n<p>Can those WABs be registered under the default context (thus making the path matching work for the wab and servlets)? I've tried this with a DefaultServlet but then the resources aren't being served. Or is there a way to have the servlets take priority on the path matching even with the WABs being on their /custom/route context?</p>\n"
