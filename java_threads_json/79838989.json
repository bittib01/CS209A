    "title": "Spring boot Kafka batching for all partitions",
    "body": "<p>I have Spring Boot with Kafka batching and a topic with 3 partitions. For example, I want to have 1 batch with 100 records continuously if I have a lot of messages in the topic, but if I have a low rate, then I want my app to send me a batch with 100 records or to wait 10 seconds and send me as big batch as possible.<br />\nRight now, I have the following properties in my test app (concurrency is 1):</p>\n<pre><code>fetch-min-size: 60_000\nfetch-max-wait: 10_000\nmax-poll-records: 100\n</code></pre>\n<p>And the problem is that if I have 1 partition, it works fine, but if I create a topic with 3 partitions, I start getting 3 small batches with a 10-second interval each. I assume that the listener listens for partitions separately and does not combine messages from them.<br />\nIs it possible to achieve it without the creation of a custom implementation of a listener to cache the responses, probably, and then divide them by batch size? Or are there other solutions?</p>\n<p>This property does not help since I use it for now, but it creates just a delay between polls, and in case of a big queue, I process very slowly.</p>\n<pre><code>idle-between-polls\n</code></pre>\n"
