I downloaded the Jython standalone JAR file and tried to include it in my Sketchware project by copying it into the &quot;libs&quot; folder. I expected this to allow me to import and use Jython in my Sketchware project. However, I don't see any way to actually run the Python code, and the app crashes when I try to launch it. Could someone guide me through the steps required to integrate Jython into my Sketchware project? Any help would be appreciated!</p>\n"
