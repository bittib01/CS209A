    "title": "Why are some Android APKs JAR archives and some are ZIP?",
    "body": "<p>I am trying to modify Settings.apk of an Android 11 device to get rid of embedded suspicious likely malware URL in the code in order to disable potential control server communication.</p>\n<p>The original unmodified Settings.apk file identifies like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Settings.apk: Java archive data (JAR)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This can be decompiled in JADX with no errors.</p>\n<p>I can change it to .zip and unzip it, change the code, fix dex checksum and hash and re-zip it. The re-zipped file can still be decompiled in JADX without errors to inspect code changes, but the file now identifies like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Settings.apk: Android package (APK), with AndroidManifest.xml</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And it's size after zipping is about half of the original.</p>\n<p>The re-zipped and re-signed file does not work when loaded into the device.<br />\nIf I re-sign the original APK without re-zipping it, it does run even signed with my own certificate.</p>\n<p>Does anyone know how to repackage the APK into the JAR archive or what is wrong here?</p>\n"
