    "title": "Fast Way to Convert BufferedImage Pixels with a Specific Color into an Area",
    "body": "<p>I am making an image editing application using Java and would like to make a select-by-color tool. A select-by-color tool makes my variable <code>selection</code>, a subclass of <code>Area</code>, highlight pixels in the selected image based on whether or not they are a specific color, an <code>int</code>. In this code snippet <code>selectedImage</code> is the BufferedImage that is used to create the <code>Area</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>int selectedColor = selectedImage.getRGB(...based on MouseEvent...);\nfor(int x = 0 ; x &lt; selectedImage.getWidth() ; x++){\n    for(int y = 0 ; y &lt; selectedImage.getHeight() ; y++){\n        if(selectedImage.getRGB(x, y) == selectedColor){\n            selection.add(new Area(new Rectangle(x, y, 1, 1)));\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I didn't really find anything useful that resolves my problem on StackOverflow or in the Oracle Docs. I found <code>LookUpOp</code>, which is almost capable of what I'm looing for but it only works by converting <code>BufferedImage</code>s and I can't turn it into an <code>Area</code>.</p>\n<p>This code works, however it is too slow to be an acceptable way of making the tool work.</p>\n<p>EDIT:\nI tried using the answer matt gave me, and my code looks like this:\n(<code>path</code> is a <code>Path2D</code> object)</p>\n<pre><code>int selectedColor = selectedImage.getRGB(...based on MouseEvent...);\n        \nfor(int x = 0 ; x &lt; selectedImage.getWidth() ; x++){\n    for(int y = 0 ; y &lt; selectedImage.getHeight() ; y++){\n        if(selectedImage.getRGB(x, y) == selectedColor){\n            path.append(new Rectangle(x, y, 1, 1), false);\n        }\n    }\n}\nselection = new SelectionArea(path);\n</code></pre>\n<p>But it's still too slow. My computer specs are:\n3.6 gH processor\n8 GB of RAM\nThere is nothing in the SelectionArea constructor that should make it slow.</p>\n"
