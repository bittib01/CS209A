    "title": "Open compose multiplatform dialog from java activity",
    "body": "<p>I'm working on an Android application that consists of several Java modules. I'm in the process of migrating these modules to Kotlin Multiplatform, starting from the lower-level modules and moving up to the app module while maintaining continuous integration for Android platform.</p>\n<p>One challenge I'm facing is migrating views such as Activities, Fragments, and Dialogs to Compose Multiplatform, especially since these views are currently being used in Java modules.</p>\n<p>For example, consider two Java modules: Module A and Module B, where Module B is a dependency of Module A. Module B contains a DialogFragment that is opened from an Activity in Module A. If I migrate Module B to Kotlin Multiplatform and convert the DialogFragment to a Compose Dialog, will it still be possible to open this Compose Dialog from the Java-based Module A?</p>\n"
