    "title": "Schedule method is executed twice",
    "body": "<p>i have a method which needs to be executed at a specific time. I use @Schedule annotation to achieve this. When the method is executed it sends an email. The schedule works and the mail is sent at the time i want but it is sent twice so the method is somehow executed twice. Here is my code:</p>\n<pre><code>@Singleton\npublic class ScheduledClass{\n\n    @EJB\n    private SomeService someService;\n\n    @Schedule(hour = &quot;17&quot;, minute = &quot;10&quot;, persistent = false)\n    public void scheduledMethod(){\n        try{\n            //here i send the mail\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I'm not sure if this executed twice thing is happening because of the Singleton annotation. Can someone help?</p>\n"
