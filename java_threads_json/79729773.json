    "title": "Spring does not recognize @PreAuthorize inside custom annotation",
    "body": "<p>If I use the just standard way <code>@PreAuthorize(&quot;hasRole(@roleProperties.getSelect()) or hasRole(@roleProperties.getOtherSelect())&quot;)</code> over my RestController methods, the <code>@PreAuthorize</code> works perfectly fine as it should. But since I have very many methods for which I'd like to use this same <code>@PreAuthorize</code> line, I thought that I should just make my own simple annotation <code>@RequireRoleSelect</code> like this:</p>\n<pre><code>    @Target({ElementType.METHOD, ElementType.TYPE})\n    @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)\n    @PreAuthorize(&quot;hasRole(@roleProperties.getSelect()) or hasRole(@roleProperties.getOtherSelect())&quot;)\n    public @interface RequireRoleSelect {}\n</code></pre>\n<p>So I don't have to write that long <code>@PreAuthroize</code> line in my controller methods and if I ever needs to add something else to that I could easily just modify my own annotation instead of editing all the <code>@PreAuthroize</code> lines. It makes the code just more readable.</p>\n<p>The problem is that if I do this I'm getting this warning: <code>Forbidden: Access denied. One of the following annotations is required on controller methods: @Secured, @PreAuthorize, @PostAuthorize, @RolesAllowed</code>. Which in my eyes seems that Spring does not see the  <code>@PreAuthroize</code> inside my own <code>@RequireRoleSelect</code> annotation.</p>\n<p>So my question is how to make this work? If it gets super complicated then maybe there are other ways to battle this &quot;copy paste problem&quot;? I will welcome any reasonable solution.</p>\n"
