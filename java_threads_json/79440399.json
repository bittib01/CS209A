    "title": "Eclipse suddenly not recognizing java.util.TreeSet",
    "body": "<p>I work in a large Java code base with Eclipse.</p>\n<p>Yesterday Eclipse suddenly started to flag the import of <code>java.util.TreeSet</code> with the error message: <code>The import java.util.TreeSet cannot be resolved</code> and marked every use of <code>TreeSet</code> in the class as if I hadn't imported it. The tool tip for error resolution still suggests to &quot;import java.util.TreeSet&quot;, but even if I delete the old import and let it autogenerate the import again it still showed the same errors.</p>\n<p>Over time Eclipse gradually failed to recognize Treeset in more and more classes. I would say a new one every couple of minutes. Cleaning the project did not change anything. Restarting Eclipse resulted in it flagging every single instance of TreeSet in the code base and only TreeSet. HashSet, TreeMap, etc. still all work fine. I now can't run any code locally anymore that requires a TreeSet.</p>\n<p>The problem does not occur (yet?) in my other Eclipse workspaces.</p>\n<p>This happened all of a sudden for no apparent reason, I did not change any Project Configurations within the last couple of weeks.</p>\n"
