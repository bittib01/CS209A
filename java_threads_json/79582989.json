    "title": "NetBeans is glitching and calling a method that isn&#39;t there",
    "body": "<p>I'm doing homework for a Data Structures class and making a 2-3 tree in NetBeans, but there's a glitch that keeps happening where a method is called twice, but the second time, it's being called by a statement that isn't there.</p>\n<p>This is the method that is being called by the main class, <code>main.Tree23.insert()</code>. It's line 33 in my Tree23 class.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/QsHjTzMn.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/QsHjTzMn.png\" alt=\"method named insert() inside the class Tree23. Code is running in debug mode with line 46 highlighted as a callstack line where current.insertItem(data) is being called.\" /></a></p>\n<p>Here is the call stack correctly listing the method calls so far:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/8QqF9mTK.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/8QqF9mTK.png\" alt=\"Call stack displaying, from bottom to top, Tree23Remixed.main line 16, Tree23.insert line 46, and Node23.insertItem line 63.\" /></a></p>\n<p>But then, for no discernible reason, the method is called again and the line it calls is not even there. There's clearly blank space in line 51.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/UXP56lED.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/UXP56lED.png\" alt=\"method named insert() inside the class Tree23.

I have no idea how to troubleshoot this. What could be causing this glitch?</p>\n"
