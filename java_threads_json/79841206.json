    "title": "Is there a way to set $JAVA_HOME on a per project basis for Maven?",
    "body": "<p>Looking through <a href=\"https://maven.apache.org/configure.html#mavenrc-file\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maven's documentation</a>, I can see that I can set <code>$JAVA_HOME</code> in my <code>.mavenrc</code> in my home directory, but this is a global setting. I have some projects that need a specific maven version (which I manage with <a href=\"https://mvnvm.teams.work\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">mvnvm</a>) as well as a specific java version (java 11.0.29). I'd prefer if I could set <code>$JAVA_HOME</code> per project, maybe as some configuration setting I've missed that goes in one of the many <code>.mvn</code> configs.</p>\n"
