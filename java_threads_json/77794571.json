    "title": "Hibernate 6 interceptor with Spring Boot 3",
    "body": "<p>I am upgrading application from Spring Boot 2.7 and Hibernate 5.6 to Spring Boot 3.0 and Hibernate 6.2.</p>\n<p>The application has interceptor implementing <code>org.hibernate.Interceptor</code> that is registered using <code>application.yml</code> and property <code>spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.ejb.interceptor</code> like this:</p>\n<pre><code>spring:\n  jpa:\n    properties:\n      hibernate:\n        ejb:\n          interceptor: org.company.MyInterceptor\n</code></pre>\n<p>The problem is simple, after performing the upgrade the interceptor stopped working. I haven't read any changes in this regard in Hibernate or Spring Boot changelogs or migration guides, so I am wondering why this isn't working anymore.</p>\n<p>I've also read official Hibernate docs and article on Baeldung on interceptors that suggest doing something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>SessionFactory sessionFactory = getSessionFactoryBuilder(serviceRegistry)\n  .applyInterceptor(new CustomInterceptor())\n  .build();\n</code></pre>\n<p>but since everything is Spring managed and we don't use any code like this directly I am lost at how this should be applied to Spring application</p>\n"
