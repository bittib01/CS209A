    "title": "How to write an XJC plugin that replaces JClass implementations for types",
    "body": "<p>I have an xsd with some very large enums - if I allow XJC to generate actual Java enums for these types, I run into the problem described here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11883043/does-an-enum-class-containing-20001-enum-constants-hit-any-limit\">Does an Enum Class containing 2000+1 Enum Constants hit any limit?</a></p>\n<p>I do not have control over the xsd, so my solution so far has been to add a binding for XJC to use a String instead of an enum for the type, but this has the obvious downsides that it lacks enforced schema compliance and referencing specific enum values in code is challenging.</p>\n<p>I started trying to write an XJC plugin to implement the type as a class with a bunch of static constants, but the documentation on XJC plugins is scant and as far as I can tell, the Outline that I have access to in the run method of the Plugin interface doesn't allow you to replace the JClass associated with a type. It seems like this plugin step might be too late in the process, and that I need to intervene during bean generation somehow, but I don't know what I need to implement and bind to make that happen.</p>\n"
