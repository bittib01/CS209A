    "title": "Prime Number Checker iterating and printing every element when only the last element needs to be printed, How can this be solved?",
    "body": "<p>I am a beginner programmer currently writing a program that will check if a number is prime or not, and then if a number below zero, print out a couple extra details. Those details would be the maximum and minimum number entered, and all numbers + all prime numbers entered. Right now, I'm currently having a problem where if I enter a number to be checked, the program will print out a large amount of lines, varying between &quot;x is not prime' and 'x is prime.' A shortened source code is below. Any tips and advice is highly appreciated. A picture is also attached of what the console prints. <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/VJKAZuth.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">enter image description here</a></p>\n<p>Also - this is my first time asking a question here. I've tried searching around,  but didn't find anything.</p>\n<pre><code>\npublic class primechecker {\n    public static void main(String args[])\n    {\n        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);\n        int x = sc.nextInt();\n        while(x&gt;0) {\n            for(int i = 2;i&lt;x;i++)\n            {\n                if(x % i == 0)\n                {\n                    System.out.println(x + &quot; isn't quite prime.&quot;);\n                }\n                else\n                {\n                    System.out.println(x + &quot; is so prime.&quot;);\n                }\n                \n            }\n                x = sc.nextInt();\n                if(x &lt; 0)\n                {\n                    sc.close();\n                    break;\n                }\n            }   \n    }\n    }   \n</code></pre>\n<p>I tried adding a boolean, changing the else is (x % i !== 0), all of which still give me a problem. I didn't try anything you might have thought of though.</p>\n"
