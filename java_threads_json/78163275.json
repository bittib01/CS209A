    "body": "<p>So I have a code snippet similar to this. I feel like the if statements should be in a common function. I am not sure how to handle that because school and student should be passed to this function but they are of different types.</p>\n<pre><code>Teacher teacher = school.getTeachers();\nif(ObjectUtils.isEmpty(teachers) {\n    log.error(”cannot find teachers in school” + school.getSchoolName());\n    throw new Exception(”xyz”);\n} \nStudent student = teacher.getStudents();\nif(ObjectUtils.isEmpty(student)) {\n    log.error(”cannot find students in school” + school.getSchoolName());\n    throw new Exception(”xyz”);\n</code></pre>\n"
