    "title": "Understanding the difference between two Thread implementation approaches in Java?",
    "body": "<p>I'm learning about Java Threads and I've encountered two different ways to create a thread. I'm not sure about the technical differences between them:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>// Approach 1\nThread n = new Thread(new NumberGenerator(100));\n\n// Approach 2\nThread n = new Thread(new NumberGenerator(100)::run);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here's my complete example code for context:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>public class NumberGenerator implements Runnable {\n    private int limit;\n    \n    public NumberGenerator(int limit) {\n        this.limit = limit;\n    }\n    \n    @Override\n    public void run() {\n        for(int i = 0; i &lt; limit; i++) {\n            System.out.println(i);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Which approach is better and why?\n        Thread t1 = new Thread(new NumberGenerator(100));\n        Thread t2 = new Thread(new NumberGenerator(100)::run);\n        \n        t1.start();\n        t2.start();\n    }\n}\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>I've tested both approaches and they seem to work similarly, but I want to understand the underlying differences and best practices.</p>\n<p>As fas as I know, both approaches use this constructor on <strong>Thread.java</strong></p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>    public Thread(Runnable target) {\n        this(null, target, &quot;Thread-&quot; + nextThreadNum(), 0);\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>So, can they be considered as subclasses of Runnable? What are the conditions to determine if an object is Runnable in this case? What are the technical differences between these two approaches?</p>\n"
