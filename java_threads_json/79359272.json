    "body": "<p>I have to display colors from the color class which displays 3 times and I need to add instances of 3 different colors using threads, the problem is that I don't know how to start because the 3rd color is supposed to start displaying when any of the first ones finishes:</p>\n<pre><code>public class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {\n\n        Color color1 = new Color(“Blue”);\n        Color color2 = new Color(“Red”);\n        Color color3 = new Color(“White”);\n   }\n}\n\nclass Color implements Runnable{\n    private String color ;\n\n    public Color(String color) {\n      this.color = color;\n  }\n\n  public void run() {\n      for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\n          System.out.println(color);\n          try {\n              Thread.sleep(300);\n          } catch (InterruptedException e) {\n              Thread.currentThread().interrupt();\n          }\n      }\n  }\n</code></pre>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>Result what I need must print in console 3 times blue 3 times red 3 times white, but when either blue or red finishes working, the thread printing white must start. The first two threads should start immediately but the third one should only start once either of the first two threads complete their work.</p>\n<p>I was thinking of using <code>BlockingQueue</code> queues, but I am not sure if this is a good idea.</p>\n"
