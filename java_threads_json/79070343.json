    "body": "<p>I got a Java Spring Boot 3 reactive application and I found that, when the servers are being shutdown gracefully, some of the remaining requests (making external calls using WebClient) are failing due to exception:</p>\n<pre><code>IllegalStateException: executor not accepting a task\n</code></pre>\n<p>This exception seems to come from Netty and is thrown if executor.isShuttingDown().</p>\n<p>Is there a way to make the application wait gracefully for all the existing Reactive requests to be completed before shutting down Netty?</p>\n"
