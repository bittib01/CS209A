    "body": "<p>I work for a fairly large company that unfortunately has an unchangeable company policy of enforcing line breaks in method chains only via line comments due to the mandated formatter.</p>\n<p>So our chains look something like this</p>\n<pre><code>list.stream() //\n .map(...) //\n .filter(...) //\n .collect(...);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Without the comments, the IDE delivers helpful inlay hints of intermediate types (when turned on). However, as soon as a comment at the end of the line is present, those hints vanish.</p>\n<p>Is there a setting I wasn't able to find to change this behavior?</p>\n"
