    "title": "Is there a Database First approach in Java like Entity Framework in C#?",
    "body": "<p>I’m used to working with a <strong>Database First</strong> approach in C#. I design my database schema (often with MySQL Workbench) and do a forward engineering, then generate my C# models using Entity Framework’s. This way, I get classes matching my tables automatically and can use LINQ to manipulate data without writing all the objects manually.</p>\n<p>I’m looking for something similar in Java a tool or framework that can generate Java classes from an existing database and let me easily work with data through an ORM.</p>\n<p>Does Hibernate or JPA support this? What’s the best way to do “Database First” in Java?</p>\n<p>Thanks for your help!</p>\n"
