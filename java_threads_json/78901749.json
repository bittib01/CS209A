    "body": "<p>I'm doing a <strong>Java</strong> project targeting android 14 using Android Studio Hedgehog | 2023.1.1 Patch 1.</p>\n<p>I've found a project of gauge views that was made in <strong>Kotlin</strong> and I want to include it to my original project so I can use its libraries (it has to be local, not from git link, because I'm gonna make some changes on it).</p>\n<p>I copied the whole external project to the root folder like this:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/4ESq4yLj.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Folder of my project</a></p>\n<p>Looking for how I could do that, i've found in here that I should include the following to my &quot;settings.gradle.kts&quot; file:</p>\n<p><code>include(&quot;SpeedView&quot;)</code></p>\n<p>But after that, the following error occurs:</p>\n<p>&quot;<strong>&gt; Build was configured to prefer settings repositories over project repositories but repository 'MavenRepo' was added by build file 'SpeedView\\build.gradle'</strong>&quot;</p>\n<p>Then I've found that I should exclude the following lines from file &quot;settings.gradle.kts&quot;:</p>\n<pre><code>dependencyResolutionManagement{\n    repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS)\n    repositories{\n        google()\n        mavenCentral()\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>But doing so, my project doesn't compile anymore, showing the following errors:</p>\n<p><strong>&quot;Caused by: org.gradle.api.internal.artifacts.ivyservice.DefaultLenientConfiguration$ArtifactResolveException: Could not resolve all files for configuration ':app:debugRuntimeClasspath'.&quot;</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Txt6IGJj.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Erros when compiling</a>\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ra0cPKkZ.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Errors when compiling</a></p>\n<p>I'd appreciate if someone could help me.</p>\n"
