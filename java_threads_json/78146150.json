    "body": "<p>RestClient has arrived in Spring Boot 3.2. There are a lot of articles and guides online using the good old RestTemplate, not so much about the new arrival. Using the new RestClient, how can I set a proxy in order to make a call to an external IP?</p>\n<p>An example where there would also be authentication at the proxy would be best.\nSomething like the solution given here for RestTemplate : <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31273236/spring-resttemplate-and-proxy-auth\">Spring RestTemplate and Proxy Auth</a></p>\n<p>Thanks for any help.</p>\n"
