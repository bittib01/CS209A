    "body": "<h3>NoClassDefFoundError caused by protobuf dependency conflict when using Milvus Java SDK in a Spring Boot project</h3>\n<p>I’m integrating the <strong>Milvus Java SDK (Milvus 2.x)</strong> into a <strong>Spring Boot application</strong>, and I’m running into a dependency conflict related to <code>protobuf-java</code>.</p>\n<p>My project already depends on several third-party libraries, some of which bring in their own versions of <code>protobuf-java</code>. To avoid conflicts, I tried excluding all protobuf-related dependencies from my project and relied only on the version provided by the Milvus Java SDK.</p>\n<p>However, during application startup—when the Milvus client is being initialized—the following exception is thrown:</p>\n<pre><code>java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com/google/protobuf/Message\n    at io.milvus.client.MilvusServiceClient.&lt;init&gt;(...)\n</code></pre>\n<p>According to the dependency tree, the effective protobuf version at runtime is:</p>\n<pre><code>com.google.protobuf:protobuf-java:3.25.5\n</code></pre>\n<p>This issue occurs consistently across multiple Milvus 2.x versions, not just a specific release.</p>\n<p>What is the recommended way to manage the <code>protobuf-java</code> dependency when using the Milvus Java SDK in a Spring Boot project, so that runtime errors like <code>NoClassDefFoundError</code> can be avoided?</p>\n"
