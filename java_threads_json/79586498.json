    "body": "<p>I have a bunch of files from which I need to read parts of the filename. Therefore I thought a great use for regex and grouping :D\nthe file could be named kb123.pdf or KB123.pdf so there is always kb or KB in the beginning and then 3 digits followed by .pdf\nI have the following code, but get &quot;OH NO&quot;s</p>\n<pre><code>Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile(&quot;^kb|KB(\\\\d{3})\\\\.pdf&quot;);\n        Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(&quot;kb165.pdf&quot;);\n        if(matcher.matches()) {\n            System.out.println(&quot;YAY&quot;);\n        }else {\n            System.out.println(&quot;OH NO&quot;);\n        }\n</code></pre>\n<p>can anyone please explain, why the regex from the debugger in correct format (&quot;\\&quot; got transformed in the debugger to the resulting &quot;&quot;) as it shows to me:</p>\n<pre><code>^kb|KB(\\d{3})\\.pdf\n</code></pre>\n<p>works on regex101, but not in java?\n<a href=\"https://regex101.com/r/uRHkd0/1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://regex101.com/r/uRHkd0/1</a></p>\n"
