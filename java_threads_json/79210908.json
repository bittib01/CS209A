    "body": "<p>I can't get anything to show up on screen. I have created a Empty Views Action then written the following code. (Copied from youtube where it works)</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>public class GamePanel extends SurfaceView implements SurfaceHolder.Callback {\n    private Paint redpaint = new Paint();\n    public GamePanel(Context context) {\n        super(context);\n        getHolder().addCallback(this);\n        redpaint.setColor(Color.RED);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void surfaceCreated(@NonNull SurfaceHolder holder) {\n        Canvas c = holder.lockCanvas();\n        c.drawRect(50,50,100,100,redpaint);\n        holder.unlockCanvasAndPost(c);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void surfaceChanged(@NonNull SurfaceHolder holder, int format, int width, int height) {\n\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void surfaceDestroyed(@NonNull SurfaceHolder holder) {\n\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n        setContentView(new GamePanel(this));\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I have checked all kinds of things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I have changed the background color to make sure I can see the view</li>\n<li>I have checked that <code>c</code> (the canvas from <code>lockCanvas()</code>) is not null</li>\n<li>I have checked that visibility for this and parent is 0</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And all other kinds of checks that ChatGPT said I should do</p>\n<p>I have now narrowed the problem down to the emulator. I tried connecting my phone which seemed to fix the problem. However, since I would like to use the emulator this still poses a problem.</p>\n<p>The emulator seems to be working fine but whatever I draw to the screen never shows up.</p>\n"
