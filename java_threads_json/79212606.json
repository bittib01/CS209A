    "title": "Can the threads handling api requests and used in multithreading inside the request belong to same thread pool, in springboot?",
    "body": "<p>I have built a SpringBoot application with REST APIs, One of these  multithreaded APIs  is implemented using executor service.</p>\n<p><div class=\"snippet\" data-lang=\"js\" data-hide=\"false\" data-console=\"true\" data-babel=\"false\" data-babel-preset-react=\"false\" data-babel-preset-ts=\"false\">\r\n<div class=\"snippet-code\">\r\n<pre class=\"snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override\"><code>ExecutorService service = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(threadPoolSize);</code></pre>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</p>\n<p>Now my question is that if a thread is created to handle a request, when this thread gets free, can it be used to handle the multithreading tasks (handled by executor service), aka can these two share same thread pools.\nThere is no other configuration done wrt executor service, or tomcat.</p>\n<p>Also if you guys can link some articles or other resources to better understand  multithreading in springboot and java, it would be of great help. I am new to these concepts.</p>\n"
