    "title": "Why do Java 2D arrays allow holding rows larger than their specified size?",
    "body": "<p>While coding, I noticed an interesting outcome. I created a 2D char array with a declared size of char[10][10]. However, I found that I could assign char arrays with more characters than the specified size to its rows. Let me demonstrate:</p>\n<pre><code>char[][] positions = new char[10][10];\nfor(int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {\n   positions[i] = f.readLine().toCharArray();\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>here, if f.readLine().toCharArray() creates an array with more than 10 characters, the 2D array still seems to accept it. When I print out the positions array using a double for-each loop, it even includes the extra characters.</p>\n<p>For example, if the input is</p>\n<pre><code>aaaaaaaaaa\nbbbbbbbbbb\ncccccccccc\ndddddddddd\neeeeeeeeee\nffffffffff\ngggggggggggg - (12 characters long, 2 extra)\nhhhhhhhhhh\niiiiiiiiii\njjjjjjjjjj\n</code></pre>\n<p>The output includes all of the exact characters, including the 2 extra ones from gggggggggggg!</p>\n<p>I’m not encountering any errors, but I find it interesting that this works since a 2D array isn’t a list and requires set sizes. Does this behavior cause any potential issues, or is it perfectly fine to do this? Just curious, thanks!</p>\n"
