    "body": "<p>I have <code>@SuppressWarnings(&quot;javadoc&quot;)</code> on almost every class. My IDE gives me a warning on virtually all of them: &quot;Redundant suppression&quot;.\nI assume advances in technology have made this annotation obsolete, but\nwould like to understand what this annotation did in the first place. I could not find anything helpful. Apparently it suppresses compiles warnings, but I couldn't find anything on the argument &quot;javadoc&quot;. And my code does compile, why would javadoc stand in the way of compiling anyway?</p>\n"
