    "title": "How to execute Quartz jobs in virtual threads",
    "body": "<p>How can I leverage virtual threads to execute I/O-bound Quartz jobs within a Quarkus microservice, handling programmatic job triggering without cron-based scheduling?\nWe are considering Quartz for our Quarkus microservice that will perform I/O bound, long running jobs (basically, a lot of HTTP requests over a period of time). We would like to use virtual threads for these jobs, but Quartz doesn't seem to have any first class support for them. These jobs will be triggered programmatically by users, not by a cron-like scheduling, so we can't rely on Quarkus' @Scheduled. Is there a standard approach to this?</p>\n<p>We have considered a custom thread pool (<a href=\"https://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/quartz-2.3.0/configuration/ConfigThreadPool.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/quartz-2.3.0/configuration/ConfigThreadPool.html</a>) but the documentation is very sparse and barely mentions it.</p>\n"
