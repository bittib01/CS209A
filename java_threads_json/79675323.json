    "body": "<p>I need to load a pretty complex object from application properties. The problem is, that I have to operate inside an <code>ApplicationListener&lt;ApplicationPreparedEvent&gt;</code>, aka the application is not fully loaded yet. So I guess, any annotation based approach is off reach.</p>\n<p>Is there a way to get the same functionality in a programmatic way? I have access to the ConfigurableEnvironment and all the properties are already loaded.</p>\n<p>What I tried so far:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Iterate all ConfigurableEnvironment::getPropertySources</li>\n<li>Filter the ones that are instance of EnumerablePropertySource</li>\n<li>collect all their properties and write them into a String</li>\n<li>Use Jackson's <code>JavaPropsMapper</code> to convert this string to my model</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Super hacky. It kinda works, except one detail: arrays coming from different PropertySources get &quot;merged&quot; instead of the expected behaviour, where the array with the higher precedence completely overrides the lower precedence ones. I need this to work as expected since I have profile-specific application-xxx.yaml files that are expected to override the default arrays from application.yaml. The expected array-overriding behaviour is described here: <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41170316/combine-list-from-multiple-spring-boot-yaml-files/41409743#41409743\">Combine list from multiple spring-boot YAML files</a></p>\n<p>So, seems like my hacky solution implements some @ConfiruationProperties features, but not others. Feels like I am reinventing the wheel, and doing so badly.</p>\n<p>Is there a solution where I get the proper functionality of @ConfigurationProperties in my ApplicationListener?</p>\n"
