    "body": "<p>I am creating a set of libraries for in-house use, and I have a reactor pom setup to build all these libraries.</p>\n<p>I want to be able to build them all at once, with one command.</p>\n<p>However, the contexts where the libraries will be used have different base Java runtimes.</p>\n<p>Because I want to build them all at once I need to have the Java version I run this build as the most recent Java version I'm targeting.</p>\n<p>However, while I know that I can set the compiler target in each of my projects to match the java version where that project will be used how can I guarantee that I won't inadvertently use a method or class in that project that is only available in the more recent version of Java I'm using to build these libraries?</p>\n"
