    "title": "How to call varargs method in ByteBuddy in a way that bakes the arguments array as constants into the bytecode?",
    "body": "<p>I'm generating classes with ByteBuddy. In one place, I need to call a static utility method which accepts varargs of type String. My code looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code>String[] myStringArray = generateParameters()\nMethodCall.invoke(utilsCall)\n  .with(myStringArray)\n</code></pre>\n<p>This seems to work just fine. While the JVM that generated the code is running, I can create an instance of the generated class via reflection and call the generated method just fine. However, if I call <code>getBytes()</code> on the generated class and write it to a *.jar file, said file will look like this (after decompilation):</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>public class MyGeneratedClass {\n\n  // $FF: synthetic field\n  public static String[] methodCall$p1kp7a1;\n  \n  public void myGeneratedMethod(){\n      MyUtils.myStaticMethod(methodCall$p1kp7a1)\n  }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Consequently, attempting to load this *.jar file and calling <code>myGeneratedMethod</code> throws a <code>NullPointerException</code>, because the synthetic field generated by ByteBuddy was never initialized. In fact, the generated *.class file does not show any traces of the contents of <code>myStringArray</code> I passed into the method during the initial generation step.</p>\n<p>What am I doing wrong? I need to be able to write the generated classes to files and load them in later, with the arguments &quot;baked in&quot;.</p>\n"
