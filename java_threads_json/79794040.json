    "body": "<p>Using Java 25 with the new <a href=\"https://openjdk.org/jeps/467\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">JEP 467: Markdown Documentation Comments</a>, I tried to add the following:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>/// @see [Example Site](https://example.com/)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Javadoc (invoked by Maven) complained &quot;error: unexpected content&quot;, with a <code>^</code> under the ending <code>)</code>.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://openjdk.org/jeps/467\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">JEP 467</a> spec says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You can use all other forms of Markdown links, including links to URLs ….<br />\n…<br />\nThe inline and block tags are parsed in the same way as for traditional documentation comments, except that tag content is also parsed as Markdown.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus I don't see anything that indicates that Markdown URL links may not be used in a <code>@see</code> block.</p>\n<p>My objective is not to find another way to link to classes or methods. I truly want to link to a URL. Many things we write are inspired, influenced, or guided by blog articles or even Stack Overflow. So to make things meta, if I were writing a Java implementation of Javadoc parsing I might just reference this very Stack Overflow question!</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>/// Parses Javadoc Markdown comments and returns a Markdown node tree.\n/// @implNote Supports Markdown for the `@see` tag.\n/// @see [Java 25 Javadoc not allowing Markdown URL link syntax in `@see`](https://stackoverflow.com/q/79794040)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Can someone confirm this is a Javadoc bug, and let me know where I can file a bug against that tool? (I don't have an OpenJDK account, so I seem unable to file one at <a href=\"https://bugs.openjdk.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://bugs.openjdk.org/</a> .)</p>\n"
