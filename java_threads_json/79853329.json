    "body": "<p>I am using Java to try to read through a CSV file I have.</p>\n<p>I have links in the file and I want to download each link as\na separate <code>*.html</code> file.</p>\n<p>What I have so far isn't much, but I was stuck about how to approach this. I was also thinking that I could use <em>Selenium</em> for this as well. If anyone has any tips or methods, it would be greatly appreciated. I can figure out the rest of my code on my own, but I just wanted to know if anyone had any input. Thank you.</p>\n<pre><code>import java.io.FileInputStream;\nimport java.io.InputStream;\n\npublic class CSVReader{\n    public static void main(String[] args){\n        try{\n            InputStream input = new FileInputStream(&quot;acm_papers_january_a_474.csv&quot;);\n            input.read();\n            System.out.println(&quot;Data read from the file: &quot; + input);\n            input.close();\n\n        } catch (Exception e){\n            e.getStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n"
