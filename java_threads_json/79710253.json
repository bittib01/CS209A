    "title": "How to provide resources from MCP client to ChatClient in Spring AI",
    "body": "<p>I have implemented both MCP server and MCP client using Spring AI. MCP server provides some tools and also exposes resources. The client is able to connect to the server and it is able to detect that there are resources in server.</p>\n<pre><code>    var chatClient = chatClientBuilder\n            .defaultToolCallbacks(new SyncMcpToolCallbackProvider(mcpSyncClients))\n            .build();\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is basically what I am doing in order to provide the tools from MCP client to the Chat client and when prompting, it is able to call the tools and then provide response.</p>\n<p>Now, my question is, how do I provide resources from MCP client to the Chat Client, is there some method like <code>.defaultResources()</code> (or) the approach is completely different for resources.</p>\n<p>For additional information, The MCP server has some documents in resources and I am able to see resource list and content through MCP inspector.</p>\n<p>I am asking the question here because I could not find relevant documentation or examples of how to use resources in chat client. I can provide additional information if required.</p>\n"
