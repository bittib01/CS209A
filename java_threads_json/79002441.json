    "title": "Certificate is not being accepted with Chrome version 128.X.X.X",
    "body": "<p>I am using Selenium with Java to test a web application.</p>\n<p>When accessing the web app manually, I get a popup to select a certificate file. There is only 1 cert file in this popup, which is also available in Personal -&gt; Certificates in my cert manager.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/gwA42c3I.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/gwA42c3I.png\" alt=\"Cert popup\" /></a></p>\n<p>To disable this popup and remove the need to manually accept the cert when running automated tests, I have done the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Added the ChromeOption:\n<code>options.setAcceptInsecureCerts(true);</code></p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Added DesiredCapabilities:\n<code>capabilities.setCapability(CapabilityType.ACCEPT_SSL_CERTS, true);</code></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I am not sure if this information is relevant but I have recently upgraded the Chrome browser version to 128.0.6613.85. The popup appears and waits for me to manually accept it. Even when run headless, it waits to be accepted and then fails.</p>\n<p>I tried using the ChromeOptions:\n--disable-machine-cert-request\n--disable-signin-frame-client-certs</p>\n<p>Is there a solution for this?</p>\n"
