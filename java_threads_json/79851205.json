    "body": "<p>I’m wondering why we have both the request and the response in a single <code>ServerWebExchange</code> object in Spring WebFlux. Why didn’t they provide a separate object for each, as in Spring MVC?</p>\n<p>I asked this from an Ai, it answered :</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Reactive chains can pause and resume later (possibly on different threads). There’s no stable thread-local like in MVC.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Assuming we don’t use <code>publishOn</code> or <code>subscribeOn</code>, can a single request be handled by multiple threads? Each event-loop thread processes events from its own queue and writes the response to the client; it doesn’t hand the work off to another thread!why the AI is saying that?</li>\n</ul>\n"
