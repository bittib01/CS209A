    "body": "<p>Ive updated docx4j from from 8.3.9 to 11.4.11 ow that Im running java 17 and when we try to convert docx to pdf we receive a noSuchMethodError.  On research the RangeFinder Class has changed where the constructor start takes  2 args was removed</p>\n<pre><code>public RangeFinder(String startElement, String endElement) {\n        \n        this.startElement = &quot;org.docx4j.wml.&quot; + startElement;\n        this.endElement   = &quot;org.docx4j.wml.&quot; + endElement;\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>only the default constructor is present in the core lib</p>\n<p>How to solve this issue?</p>\n<p>Tried the older version and different versions of the lib, saw that the class changed 8.3.10, so it appears it has been an issue</p>\n<p>checked the docx4j forum and saw no reports</p>\n<p>One solution I have is to make the change to the source and recompile the class</p>\n"
