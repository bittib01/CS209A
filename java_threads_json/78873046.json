    "body": "<p>I have a JavaServer Pages (JSP) application and I'm trying to run it in VSCode using the Community Server Connector extension with Tomcat server. I have some environment variables that are used in the project. They are currently defined in the .bashrc file, but this causes the variables to be defined throughout the machine's environment. I would like to define them only for the specific project. Is there a way to do this? If so, how?</p>\n<p>I have very little experience in the Java universe, but I need to run this project.</p>\n<p>When they are configured in .bashrc it works.</p>\n"
