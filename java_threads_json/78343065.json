    "title": "Strategies for Achieving Decoupling Between API Methods and User Interfaces",
    "body": "<p>What are the proven strategies for achieving decoupling between API methods and user interfaces?</p>\n<p>I'm working on creating a REST API service for the application. And I noticed that my API methods are strongly coupled with the user interface.</p>\n<p>Let's assume that I have this simple entity in my app</p>\n<pre><code>public class User{\n    private String username;\n    private List&lt;String&gt; roles;\n    private Set&lt;String&gt; permissions;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now let's have a look at the user interface.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/3mpb9.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/3mpb9.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>There are two pages in the user interface, one allows an admin to create a user by specifying his username and roles. Another page allows an admin to issue permissions.</p>\n<p>This means that I have to create two API methods, one to create a user and assign roles. And another one for issuing permissions.</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>public class UserService{\n    public User createUser(User user){\n        // save user to db\n        // assign roles;\n    }\n    \n    public User assignPermissions(Integer userId, List&lt;String&gt; permissions){\n        // find user from db\n        // assign permissions\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Why should I strictly follow the UI? In my opinion, it is more logical to create three API methods, one for creating a user, another for assigning roles and the last for issuing permits.</p>\n<p>So, how can I achieve this decoupling?</p>\n"
