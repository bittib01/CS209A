    "title": "Client and Server Side share same resources",
    "body": "<p>I’m making a simple chat application in Java using the <code>java.net</code> package. Both the client and server sides, I've separated to different projects.</p>\n<p>However, I’m struggling to keep a clean design. For example, I have a class called <code>Request</code> (which implements <code>Serializable</code>) that contains information such as the type of request (stored in an enum). Because of this, I need both the <code>Request</code> class and the enum of request types, so I end up sharing them between the client and server projects.</p>\n<p>Is it a good approach for the client and server to share the same classes? Or is there a better design that avoids this? How can I better separate concerns in this kind of situations?</p>\n<p>Please give me some guidelines on how to handle this of issue. Thanks!!</p>\n"
