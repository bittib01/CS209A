    "title": "Maven MINGW support requires --add-opens java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED",
    "body": "<p>After I upgraded my Maven from 3.9.6 into 3.9.8 every command that I run in Git Bash of Git for Windows 2.45.2.windows.1 (Mintty 3.7.1) prints this message twice. For example:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-bash prettyprint-override\"><code>$ mvn --version\nMINGW support requires --add-opens java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED\nMINGW support requires --add-opens java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED\nApache Maven 3.9.8 (36645f6c9b5079805ea5009217e36f2cffd34256)\nMaven home: C:\\develop\\apache-maven-3.9.8\nJava version: 17.0.11, vendor: Oracle Corporation, runtime: C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk-17\nDefault locale: en_US, platform encoding: Cp1252\nOS name: &quot;windows 11&quot;, version: &quot;10.0&quot;, arch: &quot;amd64&quot;, family: &quot;windows&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<p>I've tried to find the code in Apache Maven that prints this message but didn't find anything like that. Looked at the repository cloned from <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/maven\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://github.com/apache/maven</a> Googling and reading the release notes also didn't help. The only thing that I know is this behavior has started from Maven 3.9.7.</p>\n<p>Could someone shed light on this change and explain why and where it was done in the Maven source code? Or maybe it's printed by one of its dependencies? By which one?</p>\n"
