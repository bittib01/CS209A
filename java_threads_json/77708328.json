    "body": "<p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>With DTO is response faster</strong></p>\n<p>Why  ? When you make a endpoint without DTO for example @GetMapping(&quot;/{id}&quot;) which give you that exact &quot;Employee&quot; which have 20columns,but Domain need just 3columns, Frontend guy can from Json get that data by response.Name or response.LastName. What is exactly here faster which DTO ? Because that data is pulled from database anyway and with same speed with DTO or without no ?</p>\n"
