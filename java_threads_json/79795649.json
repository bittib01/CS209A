    "title": "Does adding opens configuration in maven surefire plugin effect anything outside the test scope?",
    "body": "<p>I'm working on a user-related service that handles personal information. While writing unit tests with Mockito, I ran into dependency issues with Byte Buddy, which prevented me from using the latest version of Mockito.</p>\n<p>As a workaround, I'm using Mockito version 1.10.19. To make the tests run successfully, I added the following configuration to my <code>pom.xml</code>:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-xml prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;plugin&gt;\n    &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.maven.plugins&lt;/groupId&gt;\n    &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-surefire-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n    &lt;version&gt;3.2.5&lt;/version&gt;\n    &lt;configuration&gt;\n        &lt;argLine&gt;--add-opens java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens java.base/java.util=ALL-UNNAMED&lt;/argLine&gt;\n    &lt;/configuration&gt;\n&lt;/plugin&gt; \n</code></pre>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Concern</strong></p>\n<p>My senior mentioned that since this is a user service dealing with personal data, I need to make sure that the configuration above doesn't:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Interfere with anything outside the test scope, or</li>\n<li>Pose any security risks to the service or user data.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Additional context</strong></p>\n<p>I've also tried mocking dependencies manually, but since the service involves JDBI, it’s been challenging to handle. So I’d like clarification on:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Whether it’s safe to continue using Mockito (with this setup).</li>\n<li>If there’s a better or safer approach for testing JDBI-based services.</li>\n<li>Any useful articles or resources related to testing with Mockito and JDBI.</li>\n</ol>\n"
