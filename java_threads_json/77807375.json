    "title": "Why do Java 21 virtual threads need less memory than platform threads?",
    "body": "<p>I do understand that platform threads are expensive as it needs more memory and it's prone to CPU context switching.</p>\n<p>But in case of virtual threads where an unimaginably large number of virtual threads can be served by a handful of platform threads, doesn't the virtual threads still need memory space to passivate the context/stack and then attach it to the carrier thread?</p>\n<p>How does it make a difference in terms of memory?</p>\n<p>Why doesn't spinning 10000 virtual threads die out of memory while 10000 platform thread does?</p>\n<p>Both of them need the same stack? And the context where the application related information need to be maintained, right?</p>\n<p>Is there any extra overhead in the memory that's only applicable to the platform threads and this is the reason why we say virtual threads are &quot;lighter&quot; in memory? If so what's that that makes this difference?</p>\n"
