    "title": "What is an efficient alternative to creating dozens of ActionListener implementations in Java?",
    "body": "<p>I'm designing a P2P messaging application using Swing, and have been running into serious issues when it comes to organizing my GUI component <code>ActionListener</code>s. Each <code>JButton</code> and <code>JTextField</code> almost always needs its own <code>ActionListener</code> implementation designed, because each component naturally has a different effect on the application than the others. My immediate thought was to just use lambdas to define an <code>actionPerformed()</code> call for each unique component, but this becomes even more problematic, because lambdas cannot be passed any parameters from the caller (as far as I know) since we don't have any constructor to use as a passer. In short, it seems I have to choose between two options:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a new class implementing <code>ActionListener</code> for each component requiring unique action logic, cluttering my codebase to a preposterous degree (BUT allowing for parameter passing via said class's constructor/native methods).</li>\n<li>Use an <code>actionPerformed()</code> lambda for each component requiring unique action logic, streamlining my codebase while requiring a complete redesign of said logic's details due to the loss of parameter passing.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I would be stunned, however, if this bad choice road is the reality of the situation. Is there an alternative to these poor options? Maybe a programming paradigm I've entirely overlooked?</p>\n"
