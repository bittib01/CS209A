    "body": "<p>I have a basic micronaut CRUD application which manages contacts through a Rest API. When running the app locally using graalvm-ce 21.0.2, the API returns the contact response as expected.</p>\n<p>When I package the app using native packaging (docker-native or native-image) using:\n<code>mvn clean compile package -Dpackaging=native-image</code>, my app doesn't return the Contact entity with all the properties</p>\n<p>This is how the ContactResponse POJO looks like:</p>\n<pre><code>@Builder\npublic record ContactResponse(\n        String id,\n        String name,\n        String address,\n        String phoneNumber,\n        String email,\n\n        @JsonFormat(pattern = ObjectMapperConfig.API_DATE_TIME_PATTERN)\n        LocalDateTime createdAt\n)\n</code></pre>\n<p>And calling the API (after packaging) returns:</p>\n<pre><code>{\n   &quot;createdAt&quot;: &quot;2025-10-14T12:35:41&quot;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Adding @JsonProperty() to a field makes it appear in the response. After doing some research, i found that during the native executable building, graalvm compiler removes all items which are &quot;not needed&quot;, including Reflective access, for performance reasons.</p>\n<p>Since i'm using Jackson databind in my project, which relies on Java Reflection, I made it work by adding <strong>@ReflectiveAccess</strong> to force the compiler to generate reflection metadata for that specific object (ContactResponse)</p>\n<p>I'd like to know if there's a way to reproduce this issue during the development process (and not during the packaging) so that my tests fail before i package and deploy. My tests are happening before i package the app into a native executable and thus can't discover this in advance.</p>\n"
