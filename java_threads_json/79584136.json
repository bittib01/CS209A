    "body": "<p>I'm working with Spring Expression Language (SpEL) and noticed that expressions like @bar.int and @bar.getInt() both seem to access values from a Spring bean.</p>\n<p>What is the actual difference between these two expressions?</p>\n<pre><code>#{@bar.int}\n\n#{@bar.getInt()}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Any clarification would be appreciated!</p>\n<p>I understand both may resolve to the same value if getInt() is a standard getter method, but are there any behavioral differences in how SpEL interprets these?</p>\n<p>Also, are there any implications related to Spring Security, method invocation restrictions, or best practices when choosing between them?</p>\n"
