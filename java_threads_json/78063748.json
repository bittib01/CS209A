    "title": "Java BiFunction to manipulate data over an iteration",
    "body": "<p>I'm writing a Java code that looks like this, and I have the feel it could be improved with some functional programming stuff :)</p>\n<pre><code>int rank = 1;\n\nfor (int i = 0; i &lt; activities.size(); i++) {\n    if (i == 0) {\n        activities.get(i).setRank(rank);\n    else {\n        float currentAverage = activities.get(i).getQualityAverage();\n        float previousAverage = activities.get(i - 1).getQualityAverage();\n\n        activities.get(i).setRank(currentAverage == previousAverage ? rank : ++rank);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Assuming that activities List is sorted, the sense of this code is to assign a rank (a score) to every activity according with its place in the list. But there's a rule in the <code>else</code> case (when the iteration is equal or higher than second element) where I'm using the rank assigned to the previous element if both elements' <code>qualityAverage</code> property is exactly the same.</p>\n<p>For instance:</p>\n<div class=\"s-table-container\"><table class=\"s-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Activity</th>\n<th>Quality Average</th>\n<th>Rank</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Read</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Workout</td>\n<td>9.5</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Write</td>\n<td>9.2</td>\n<td>3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Study</td>\n<td>9.2</td>\n<td>3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Clean</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Play guitar</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>4</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div>\n<p>As I mentioned at the beginning, how could I write a Java BiFunction (maybe something similar to <code>reduce()</code>) in order to achieve a cleaner and smarter code.</p>\n"
