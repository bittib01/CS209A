    "body": "<p>Not really familiar with Java, but the Interoperability Engine we use provides us with Adapters we can use to connect to Database using JDBC. In the past we just had to define the Class Path with the database driver we intended to use.</p>\n<p>However, as we move to the Cloud Architecture, I am finding that I am running into some issues needing additional jar files to connect to Azure SQL. I thought I had downloaded the appropriate jar files and included them in the JDBC Class Path, but I am getting an error with SLF4J: Failed to load class &quot;org.slf4j.impl.StaticLoggerBinder&quot;.</p>\n<p>I have downloaded slf4j-api-1.7.36.jar and included it in my class path. Any idea why I would be getting this error?</p>\n"
