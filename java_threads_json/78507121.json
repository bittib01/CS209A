    "title": "Intellij Idea not recognizing files without the absolute path",
    "body": "<p>I am new to Java and intellij Idea, I was following a tutorial on how to read a file in java, when I entered any type of file path, filename ( the main class and the other file were in the same directory ), path from content root, source root, it gave FileNotFoundException except using the absolute path.</p>\n<p>I was expecting it to work only using the filename, because the main class and the other file is in the same directory. But Intellij gives FileNotFoundException</p>\n<p>I don't have a problem with using the absolute path but if I run my project anywhere else other than my computer than it will not work. That's why I want to know the solution to this problem so i can run my project on other places too.</p>\n"
