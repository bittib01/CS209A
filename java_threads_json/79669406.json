    "title": "Eclipse cannot start with Liberica JDK 21 Full (JavaFX) on macOS (ARM): &quot;libjvm.dylib does not contain the JNI_CreateJavaVM symbol&quot;",
    "body": "<p>I'm trying to run Eclipse on macOS (latest) with Liberica JDK 21 Full because I need JavaFX for SAP development. When I launch Eclipse, I get this error:</p>\n<p><code>The JVM shared library &quot;/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/liberica-jdk-21-full.jdk/Contents/Home/bin/../lib/client/libjvm.dylib&quot; does not contain the JNI_CreateJavaVM symbol.</code></p>\n<p>I've set JAVA_HOME to the Liberica JDK 21 Full path and still get this issue. . When I set the path to the normal 21 (not full), it works well but my SAP dev doesn't work. Is this a known problem with Eclipse or Liberica JDK 21 Full on macOS? How can I fix this and use JavaFX with Eclipse?</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n"
