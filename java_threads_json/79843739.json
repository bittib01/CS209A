    "title": "Quarkus native compilation requires explicit declaration of Classes to be registered for Reflection",
    "body": "<p>I'm using Quarkus enabling native compilation. At runtime I noticed some exceptions that required me to register classes for reflection e.g:</p>\n<pre><code>@RegisterForReflection(    \n   targets = { MyClass.class, MyClass2.class, ...\n</code></pre>\n<p>This solved the runtime issue.</p>\n<p>However this approach doesn't scale and seems unsafe. In some cases I might have a lot of classes requiring registration and of course doing it manually/explicitly creates the risk of missing one class and thus  eventually getting a runtime exception.</p>\n<p>Is there a best pratice around this?</p>\n"
