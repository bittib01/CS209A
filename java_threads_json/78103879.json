    "title": "Spring Boot App in Docker container - SQL Server Integrated Security",
    "body": "<p>I have a Spring Boot App (RESTful Service) that runs in a Docker Container and the Database Server is outside of the Docker Cluster, it´s on a special server cluster. In dev, the app works with &quot;Integrated security&quot; without a problem (because of my account), but in a docker container, there is no Kerberos Ticket available to work with.</p>\n<p>Is it even possible to add the JDBC Auth lib to the container and use it? I think, from a technical standpoint, I will have to switch to a username/password combo. But maybe somebody has done that already.</p>\n"
