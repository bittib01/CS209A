    "title": "Possible for Spring Boot to serve javadocs without unzipping javadoc.jar manually?",
    "body": "<p>I have a working spring boot app executing from a jar that exposes a REST API, which is  documented with springdoc/openapi/swagger by exposing on my spring boot app, too.</p>\n<p>I can create the javadoc jar with maven, and I'd like to expose those javadocs with my spring boot app.  I am able to do so if I manually unzip the jar into a directory like /static which spring boot puts into its executable jar.  No problems.</p>\n<p>But I'd like to skip the manual unzip and just use the javadoc.jar itself.  However, if I do that, an http browser request will just download the jarfile, which is undesirable.</p>\n<p>I know that Java is designed to easily read a jar file without unzipping it by setting the classpath to the jar file.  It seems that spring might have a bean for effectively reading websites inside a jar, like what javadoc makes.</p>\n<p>What I would like is for the user to enter http://localhost:8080/myapp/javadoc/index.html and spring boot would get the index.html out of /static/javadoc.jar, directly without unzipping... is that possible?</p>\n"
