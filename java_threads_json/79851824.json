    "title": "trying to import multiple projects into eclipse on Linux that used to be on Windows",
    "body": "<p>I have dozens of Java projects that I worked on in eclipse in Windows 10 (and earlier versions). I am changing my home setup to ubuntu, so I copied the entire workspaces tree over to the ubuntu machine. For a couple of projects I have used File / Import for &quot;existing project into workspace&quot; without trouble; after I imported, I was able to see all the source files in the workspace navigator view, edit them, run the program, etc.</p>\n<p>The two projects that I imported without trouble were imported &quot;in place&quot;, that is, I imported them into the workspace and left all their files in the directories where they already existed.</p>\n<p>Now I've run into one that I'm having trouble importing, called ShowPath. The projects that imported correctly were all in the same workspaces directory, /home/xfirstname/programming/workspaces/ and then each in their own xprojectname subdirectory under that. This new one is in the same workspaces directory but in an /xlastname/ShowPath subdirectory instead of just ShowPath.</p>\n<p>When I use File / Import as I have before, I see the dialog that shows the ShowPath project in that directory. I leave all the checkboxes unchecked (search for nested, copy, close, hide, and add to working sets) and click finish. I get the message: &quot;Some projects cannot be imported because they already exist in the workspace or their project file is corrupted.&quot;</p>\n<p>The .project file has:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;  \n&lt;projectDescription&gt;  \n    &lt;name&gt;ShowPath&lt;/name&gt;  \n    &lt;comment&gt;&lt;/comment&gt;  \n    &lt;projects&gt;  \n    &lt;/projects&gt;  \n    &lt;buildSpec&gt;  \n        &lt;buildCommand&gt;  \n            &lt;name&gt;org.eclipse.jdt.core.javabuilder&lt;/name&gt;  \n            &lt;arguments&gt;  \n            &lt;/arguments&gt;  \n        &lt;/buildCommand&gt;  \n    &lt;/buildSpec&gt;  \n    &lt;natures&gt;  \n        &lt;nature&gt;org.eclipse.jdt.core.javanature&lt;/nature&gt;  \n    &lt;/natures&gt;  \n&lt;/projectDescription&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>When I click on the &quot;Details&quot; button on the error dialog, it shows:</p>\n<pre><code>Invalid project description for project 'ShowPath' at 'file:/home/xfirstname/programming/workspaces/xlastname/ShowPath' /home/xfirstname/programming/workspaces/xlastname/ShowPath overlaps the workspace location /home/xfirstname/programming/workspaces/xlastname/ShowPath\n</code></pre>\n<p>Well, I know they overlap; I'm trying to import this project while leaving it in the directory tree where all its files are. I thought this is what I did for the other existing eclipse projects when it did work, I don't understand what I'm doing wrong (or differently) here.</p>\n<p>I have tried clicking the &quot;Refresh&quot; button. I have tried shutting eclipse down and starting it back up. What am I missing?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Found it -- I was opening a ShowPath project (which was empty) and then attempting to import it. Open any other workspace (or none), then do the import to go to the imported project.</p>\n"
