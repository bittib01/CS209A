    "body": "<p>I learnning kafka active/standy cluster , by read the cloudera article of  <a href=\"https://docs.cloudera.com/runtime/7.2.15/kafka-configuring/topics/kafka-configured-dns-aliases.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Connection to the cluster with configured DNS aliases</a>，i have some questions.</p>\n<p>important part of above link article: If the client has discovered a cluster and is actively using it, and the cluster suddenly stops, the client tries to connect to the bootstrap servers it got from the DNS server before the bootstrap phase. <strong>So it does not automatically ask the DNS server for new bootstrap servers and does not fail over to the other cluster, even if the DNS records have already been changed.</strong></p>\n<p>my questions:  has any solution can automatically switch kafka client reconnect the standy cluster without restart kafka client ?</p>\n<p>I used the dnsmasq service to simulate a disaster recovery scenario, and I found that the Kafka client could not automatically switch the connected standy cluster unless I manually restarted the kafka client</p>\n"
