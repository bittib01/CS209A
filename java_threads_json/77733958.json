    "title": "Create brand new weapon with BlockBench and a MineCraft Plugin API",
    "body": "<p>I would like to use Blockbench (a 3d modelling application like blender) to create an entirely new Minecraft weapon.</p>\n<p>Then, with java and some API (for example bukkit), I want to have a brand-new weapon.</p>\n<p>I do not want to retexture an existing weapon for example the diamond sword.</p>\n<p>Would someone kindly give me some pointers? For example, what is not clear for me is how to export it from Blockbench, and how to import it into minecraft.</p>\n<p>Is Bukkit the correct API to use? Does know of another API that will better meet my needs. I am not a java beginner.</p>\n"
