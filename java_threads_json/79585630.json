    "title": "Java 21 Uplift - Apache Camel XSD XML entity/resource not found",
    "body": "<p>I'm trying to update a Spring based module to Java 21 from Java 8. In particular it relies on Apache Camel. I had earlier removed <code>org.apache.camel:camel-cxf</code> in lieu of other dependencies, since its packages were <code>javax.*</code> based instead of <code>jakarta.*</code> based.</p>\n<p>However, I eventually ran into an issue where one of the XML configuration files that sets up our internal SOAP API calls actually relied on a resource file from <code>org.apache.camel:camel-cxf</code>. Namely, I'm getting the following runtime error:</p>\n<pre><code>DTD/XSD XML entity [http://camel.apache.org/schema/cxf/camel-cxf.xsd] not found, falling back to remote https resolution\n</code></pre>\n<p>Despite searching for several days now, I can't seem to find an equivalent and up-to-date dependency online that provides this resource. Hence I'm not sure which direction I should take now. I'm happy to move away from this XML based configuration in lieu of a Java DSL based one, if that allows me to move past this error.</p>\n<p>What I'm looking at right now is</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;!-- CXF End point for ourService --&gt;\n    &lt;cxf:cxfEndpoint id=&quot;serviceEndpoint&quot;\n       &lt;!-- properties and stuff--&gt;\n    &lt;/cxf:cxfEndpoint&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>where <code>cxfEndpoint</code> cannot be found due to a non-existent resource, but is referred to in a route later on. I'm not familiar with the tag/class myself so I'm not sure what/how to emulate as an alternative.</p>\n"
