    "body": "<p>Most of them only mentioned that the object header would occupy space, but their answers didn't answer my question, such as why the size of the object header affects the size of the array. The object header and the contents of the array are not stored in the same array. I mean that the object header and the array should not affect each other in terms of space occupation. Even if their combined size exceeds Interger.MAX_VALUE, their contents are not stored in the same array.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35756277/why-the-maximum-array-size-of-arraylist-is-integer-max-value-8\">Why the maximum array size of ArrayList is Integer.MAX_VALUE - 8?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31382531/why-i-cant-create-an-array-with-large-size\">Why I can't create an array with large size?</a></li>\n</ol>\n"
