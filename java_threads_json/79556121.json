    "title": "Using libraries with IntelliJ",
    "body": "<p>I'm trying to integrate a directory scanner with my project. I found two implementations but I can't use them in my project. My project is built with Maven.</p>\n<p><code>DirectoryScanner</code> class is in two libraries:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><code>org.apache.tools.ant.DirectoryScanner</code>; and</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><code>org.codehaus.plexus.util</code>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I assume they are the same. But I can't import either of them.</p>\n<p>I looked up Apache.tools.ant in some <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/ant.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Intellij documentation</a>. This link is apparently Ant plugin for a build environment. Which I gather I don't need and don't want, because I am using Maven.</p>\n<p>Neither of the obvious things works:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ZqWq9amS.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ZqWq9amS.png\" alt=\"Trying to import classes\" /></a></p>\n<p>I looked here to no avail:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/8RbqL9TK.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/8RbqL9TK.png\" alt=\"Google search for library\" /></a></p>\n<p>Update:\nThanks ViJay. That looks really promising. The Apache scanner was the first one I found, with some examples.</p>\n<p>But when the POM file is edited, this pops up.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/fARPV96t.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/fARPV96t.png\" alt=\"Editing Pom file shows this\" /></a>\nand following the link in blue is not helpful.</p>\n<p>Update: Using Dependency dialog in the POM, the following was added:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/vTMtbfQo.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/vTMtbfQo.png\" alt=\"Adding dependency to POM\" /></a></p>\n<p>But that was not found automatically.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/7oIKxxwe.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/7oIKxxwe.png\" alt=\"Import error in editor\" /></a></p>\n<p>But a google search found this:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/65HS6C5B.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/65HS6C5B.png\" alt=\"Google Search for Library\" /></a></p>\n<p>So, it looks like I have found the library on GitHub. But what do I download? and where do I put it? and how do I tell Intellij where to find it. I could look up documentation for this possibly, but I don't know what to search for. What is this process of finding, downloading and telling the IDE about a library?\nthx.</p>\n<p><strong>Still No Joy in Finding Libraries</strong></p>\n<p>Here are a pile of &quot;Reproducible Builds&quot; of what looks like the correct Library, but where is the required download and how to use it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/jvm-repo-rebuild/reproducible-central/blob/master/content/org/codehaus/plexus/plexus-utils/README.md\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://github.com/jvm-repo-rebuild/reproducible-central/blob/master/content/org/codehaus/plexus/plexus-utils/README.md</a></p>\n<p>Is the library a JAR file? There are a pile of folders here, where is the JAR or whatever it is to download?</p>\n<p>Once downloaded, the project needs to be set to find it? How to do that?\nThx</p>\n<p>UPDATE: 22 April 2025\nI'm working on another project that needs Directoryscanner and I'm trying to use the answer here and it is stuck.</p>\n<p>POM updated to add dep:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;dependency&gt;\n  &lt;groupId&gt;org.codehaus.plexus&lt;/groupId&gt;\n  &lt;artifactId&gt;plexus-utils&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n  &lt;version&gt;4.0.0&lt;/version&gt;\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\n&lt;dependency&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>module-info.java has line\nrequires plexus.utils;</p>\n<p>class has import:\nimport org.codehaus.plexus.util.DirectoryScanner;</p>\n<p>But Plexus in red in java and module info and I can'tg figure out what to do to make it not-red. before it just happened. BUT NOT NOW.\nAnybody got an idea?</p>\n<p>Code is here: version is &quot;STUCK - can't import directoryscanner&quot;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/windyweather/SyncTestGui\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://github.com/windyweather/SyncTestGui</a></p>\n"
