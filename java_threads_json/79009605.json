    "title": "How to skip migration files depending on a condition or environment in a Java Spring Boot project with Flyway?",
    "body": "<p>I'm new to Java and the Spring Boot environment (Coming from Ruby on Rails). I'm developing a Spring Boot application with Flyway, and while writing tests I'm running on an issue. I have some migrations that are Postgres Specific (making use of partial indexes), so they are failing when running on H2. I searched online for a way to skip these migrations, but found no answer.</p>\n<p>So, is there a way to specify that some migrations are only to be run when on an specific database type?</p>\n"
