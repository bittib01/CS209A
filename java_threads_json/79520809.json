    "body": "<p>I want to make a program that disables caps lock as soon as it is detected so I can use it as a keybind without worrying about my typing being in caps (in java)</p>\n<p>I've done this</p>\n<pre><code>new ProcessBuilder(&quot;powershell&quot;, &quot;-Command&quot;,\n                    &quot;$wshell = New-Object -ComObject WScript.Shell; $wshell.SendKeys('{CAPSLOCK}')&quot;).start();\n</code></pre>\n<p>but it takes about a second to actually execute. Is there a faster way of disabling the caps lock? Also is there a faster way to detect this? I have it detecting through a keybind but want to detect when the state is on rather than the keybind</p>\n"
