    "title": "JavaCV frame reading not working on Raspberry Pi",
    "body": "<p>i am currently developing an application to scan QR codes with Java and JavaCV.</p>\n<p>On my mac, it works just fine. Opens the camera, reads the frames and detects + decodes the QR code.</p>\n<p>When i run the code on my Raspberry Pi, the application starts but no frames are read.</p>\n<p>The connected camera itself is working, i already took a sample picture with libcamera-still. When i run <code>vcgencmd get_camera</code> it outputs <code>supported=0 detected=0, libcamera interfaces=0</code>. What's the issue? Can anybody help?</p>\n<p>I use Spring Boot (v 3.3.1) with Maven. My Raspberry is a model 4B.</p>\n"
