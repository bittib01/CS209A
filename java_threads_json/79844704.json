    "title": "JVM HotSpot: what does &quot;reexecute&quot; mean for JIT-compiled code?",
    "body": "<p>The JIT-compiled lines can have a <a href=\"https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/master/src/hotspot/share/code/pcDesc.hpp#L42\" rel=\"noreferrer\">reexecute</a> flag. This is related to deoptimization and I guess JVM has to re-interpret this line if it gets deoptimized? But this is all foggy for me, I can't figure out exactly why it's needed.</p>\n<p>Most assembly that I see isn't marked for reexecution, but here's an ARMv8 example which is:</p>\n<pre><code>ldr x10, [x28, #0x30]   ; ImmutableOopMap {c_rarg1=Oop }\n                        ;*goto {reexecute=1 rethrow=0 return_oop=0}\n                        ; - (reexecute)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Why this particular line? What's so special about it?</p>\n"
