    "body": "<p>This question is especially for the TimeFold framework.\nI have the following code in <code>SolutionBusiness</code> class. The <code>SolutionBusiness</code> class is same which is taken from the Nurse Rostering example with the following modification.</p>\n<pre><code>public SolutionOutput exportSolution() {\n    guiScoreDirector.calculateScore();\n    Solution_ solution = guiScoreDirector.getWorkingSolution();\n    return exporter.exportSolution(solution, guiScoreDirector.getIndictmentMap());\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I have upgraded the code from optaplanner to TimeFold, now I am getting a null value on call the method <code>guiScoreDirector.getIndictmentMap()</code>. It was working fine with Optaplanner 8.4.1.Final. The Version of TimeFold is 1.10.0.</p>\n"
