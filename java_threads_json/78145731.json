    "body": "<p>I'm starting to lose hope and sanity...\nI'm learning Java code and trying to write a program for choosing hobby, but it must be done by two methods and mine give different numbers... I don't know where to look for mistake or how to make it right. Please help!</p>\n<pre><code> public static int chooseHobbyRecursive(int[] startNumbers, int day) {\n    if (day == 0){\n        return startNumbers [0];\n    } else if (day == 1) {\n        return startNumbers [1];\n    } else if (day == 2) {\n        return startNumbers [2];\n    } else if (day == 3) {\n        return startNumbers [3];\n    } else {\n        int prev = chooseHobbyRecursive(startNumbers, day - 1);\n        int prevPrePrev = chooseHobbyRecursive(startNumbers, day - 3);\n        return (prev * prevPrePrev) % 10 + 1;\n    }\n    }\n   \n\n    public static int chooseHobbyIterative(int[] startNumbers, int day) {\n        List&lt;Integer&gt; numbers = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\n\n        numbers.add(startNumbers[0]);\n        numbers.add(startNumbers[1]);\n        numbers.add(startNumbers[2]);\n        numbers.add(startNumbers[3]);\n\n        for (int d = 0; d &lt; day; d++) {\n            int index = d + 4; \n            int prev = numbers.get(index - 1); \n            int prePrePrev = numbers.get(index - 3); \n            numbers.add((prev * prePrePrev) % 10 + 1);\n        }\n\n        return numbers.get(numbers.size() - 1);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I've been trying to rewrite the code but it usually either dies with ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException or have different numbers</p>\n<p>Output:</p>\n<pre><code>=== Day 1 ===\nIterative = 4 | Recursive = 1\n\n=== Day 2 ===\nIterative = 1 | Recursive = 20\n\n=== Day 5 ===\nIterative = 8 | Recursive = 1\n\n=== Day 15 ===\nIterative = 2 | Recursive = 3\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>UPD</strong>:\n<em>The task states:</em> At the very beginning student writes two numbers: the day and month of his birth, then two numbers - two halves of the current year. For example, if he was born on January 21 and the year is 2023, the first four numbers are 21 1 20 23. Each next number is obtained by the rule: the previous day and two days before it are taken, multiplied, the remainder of the division by 10 is taken, then 1 is added, so that there is numbering from one. Each such number will be from 1 to 10 and will be the number of the hobby he will be doing that day.</p>\n<p>I was given the iterative method and my job to create a recursive one, but I don't understand how (I figured how to make a recursive part), but somehow have no idea how to make the method chooseHobbyRecursive right.</p>\n<p>I would appreciate the explanation or/and the parts where I'm wrong or any advice really. Thanks!</p>\n"
