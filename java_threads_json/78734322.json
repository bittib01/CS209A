    "body": "<p>New Android developer here, I imagine I'm probably missing something fundamental...</p>\n<p>I have a class instance which is not initialised straight away. I pass this to a composable and want to use it after it has been initialised. Something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {\n    var camera: USBCamera? = null\n\n    public override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {\n        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)\n\n        setContent {\n            MyComposeUI(camera)\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>@Composable\nfun MyComposeUI(camera: USBCamera?) {\n    Button(onClick = { camera?.setGain(10) }) {}    \n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>The problem is this doesn't work because <code>camera</code> is always null??</strong></p>\n<p><code>camera</code> is initialised elsewhere (in a separate thread) and I can make this work by either accessing it using <code>LocalContext</code> or wrapping it in a class. (Please feel free to suggest better alternatives!)</p>\n<p>Not sure if it's relevant but the <code>USBCmera</code> class is a java class with calls to a native library</p>\n"
