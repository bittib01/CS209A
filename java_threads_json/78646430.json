    "title": "Play Console Warning: Update your Play Core Maven dependency to an Android 14 compatible version",
    "body": "<p>Received a warning in the Play Console saying the following</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Update your Play Core Maven dependency to an Android 14 compatible version! Your current Play Core library is incompatible with targetSdkVersion 34 (Android 14), which introduces a backwards-incompatible change to broadcast receivers to improve user security. As a reminder, from August 31, Google Play requires all new app releases to target Android 14. Update to the latest Play Core library version dependency to avoid app crashes</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I would like to know, what can I possibly do to solve this problem?</p>\n<p>My app is a complete native app, using Java/Kotlin and XML/Jetpack Compose</p>\n"
