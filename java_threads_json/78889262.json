    "title": "Remote process stops as soon as my Java app exits",
    "body": "<p>I'm running a remote process (that runs on remote Debian machine within its Terminal via &quot;./st.cmd&quot; command below) through my Java app which I want to keep running throughout the lifespan of my app as well as after this app exits, unless some remote user terminates it or a local user terminates it using an icon inside my app.\nRight now, it also terminates when my Java app exits. [I think this happens because the object &quot;shellChannel&quot; gets destroyed upon app exit] Following is the code:</p>\n<pre><code>public static void runProcess() {\n    RemotePC pc = (RemotePC)MainWindow.getInstance().selectedJTreeNode.getUserObject();\n    \n    try {\n        if (connectedShellChannel(pc)) { // returns true upon successful connection\n            PrintStream shellStream = new PrintStream(pc.shellChannel.getOutputStream(), true);\n            // where shellChannel is com.jcraft.jsch.Channel object created elsewhere\n            shellStream.println(&quot;./st.cmd&quot;);\n\n            shellStream.flush();\n            shellStream.close();\n\n            Prompt.ShowInfo(&quot;Specified process is now running successfully \\n on selected PC (IP: &quot; + pc.IP + &quot;)&quot;, &quot;Message from Remote PC&quot;, Global.SuccessIcon);\n        }\n    } catch (IOException e) {\n        e.printStackTrace();\n        Prompt.ShowError(&quot;A secure communication channel could not be established \\n with the Remote PC.\\n\\nSpecified process could not be run.&quot;, &quot;Secure Communication not established&quot;);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Any suggestions??</p>\n"
