    "title": "How to configure spring-data-keyvalue to use Redis for persistence?",
    "body": "<p>I have an application using spring-data-keyvalue. As I understand by default it uses HashMap without persistence. The documentation says I could use redis for that, with jedis (among others). I want to keep my application independent of the type of key-value store.\nHowever when searching documentation on ho to set it up, all of them uses spring-data-redis. Am I confused, and spring-data-redis is also the persistence engine for spring-data-keyvalue, and I just have to use something like\n<code>@EnableMapRepositories(keyValueTemplateRef = &quot;RedisTemplate&quot;)</code> ?</p>\n<p>I looked at the source of jedis, but found no class implementing Map or having template in its name. Should I really implement Map by hand to use jedis directly, or am I overlooking something?</p>\n"
