    "body": "<p>I would like to use an ErrorHandler to catch all the errors that happens during my pipeline.\nI have seen that there is an interface which allows to do so : <a href=\"https://beam.apache.org/releases/javadoc/current/org/apache/beam/sdk/transforms/errorhandling/ErrorHandler.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://beam.apache.org/releases/javadoc/current/org/apache/beam/sdk/transforms/errorhandling/ErrorHandler.html</a></p>\n<p>I would like to implement it knowing that I have custom transforms and I would like a custom Sink (LogSink or whatever).\nI've tried many ways to implement it but no success.</p>\n<p>Does anyone have a concrete example of how to implement it ?\nThanks</p>\n"
