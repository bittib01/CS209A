    "body": "<p>I want this application to be deployed on the server and running as well and I want it to be used as a dependency jar in another project. I want to exclude the resources folder only in the dependency jar(thin jar) and include it in an executable(fat) jar so that I can use it.</p>\n<p>I tried using the code below in the build.gradle file. The gradle file excludes the resources folder from both thin and fat jars.</p>\n<p><code>tasks.jar { processResources.exclude('*') }</code></p>\n<p>I am using the below versions\ngradle 8.8, java 21 and spring-boot 3.3.3</p>\n<p>Let me know what more I can add to Gradle to have this jars in place.</p>\n<p>Thanks</p>\n"
