    "body": "<p>I upgraded JHipster from 7.x to 8.11.0. But somehow I cannot find the class <code>tech.jhipster.config.locale.AngularCookieLocaleResolver</code> to import. But I couldn't find another jar that contains it. And searches also did not give me anything concrete.</p>\n<p>Currently getting compile error:</p>\n<pre><code>package tech.jhipster.config.locale does not exist\n</code></pre>\n<p>Could you please let me know if this class has been deleted/deprecated. And what to use from now on in its place?</p>\n"
