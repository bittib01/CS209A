    "title": "Validate headers in graphql + spring boot application",
    "body": "<p>I created a spring boot application with graphql.I need to add spring security for authentication and authorization. My requirement is as below.</p>\n<p>I need to validate headers, for example validate userId for incoming requests. When signIn or signUp mutations are called, there is no userId to be validated in headers. I need to permit only those signIn/signUp mutations without validating userIds in their headers.</p>\n<pre><code>@Configuration\n@EnableWebSecurity\npublic class SecurityConfiguration {\n\n    @Bean\n    public SecurityFilterChain securityFilterChain(HttpSecurity httpSecurity) throws Exception {\n        return httpSecurity\n            .authorizeHttpRequests(registry -&gt; {\n                registry.requestMatchers(&quot;/signIn&quot;, &quot;/signUp&quot;).permitAll(); // Permit signIn, and signUp\n                registry.anyRequest().authenticated(); // All other requests require authentication\n            })\n            .build();\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This type of filtering cannot afford here because there is only a single endpoint <code>http://localhost:8080/graphql</code>. How can I handle this scenario?</p>\n<p>If it is not a good approach what are the best practices of doing this authentication &amp; authorization part in spring boot + graphql application?</p>\n<p>Thanks.</p>\n"
