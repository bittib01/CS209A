    "body": "<p>I try to use OpenApi generated (spring generator) DTOs in a project (instead of handwritten DTOs), however some existing DTOs have custom serializers, e.g. <code>@JsonSerialize(using = TwoDecimalSerializer.class)</code> (as you may guess, serializer saves only 2 digits after a point).\nHow to achieve similar behaviour with OpenApiGenerator generated code? is it possible to somehow add those annotations?\nor the only way is to move that kind of code to mappers ?</p>\n"
