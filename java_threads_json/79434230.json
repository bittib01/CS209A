    "title": "Java custom exception handling. Which class to extend?",
    "body": "<p>I am taking a Java course. So I am just learning Java. The textbook says to either extend the <code>Exception</code> class or extend the <code>RuntimeException</code> class for a custom exception. I understand <code>RuntimeException</code> is a subclass of <code>Exception</code>.</p>\n<p>I have a homework assignment to implement the <code>bin2Dec</code> method to throw a custom exception if the string is not a binary string.</p>\n<p>I found the exercise worked out by somebody and was studying their solution. However, I see that they extended the <code>NumberFormatException</code> class which of course is a child of <code>IllegalArgumentException</code> which is a child of <code>RuntimeException</code>.</p>\n<p>This led me to wonder why they decided to use <code>NumberFormatException</code>? I assume I can work out a solution simply using <code>Exception</code> or <code>RuntimeException</code>. Especially since that is all that is covered in the text.</p>\n<p>I tried searching the web to find answers to this question but all I found was several places stating basically what the book says (extend <code>Exception</code> or <code>RuntimeException</code>) and explaining (as the book does) when to use one vs the other.</p>\n<p>All I was able to find was several articles saying that you &quot;can&quot; use a more appropriate subclass like <code>NumberFormatException</code> but no explanation of how a person would come to that conclusion when setting out to make a custom exception. I found one article saying extending <code>NumberFormatException</code> is almost always a bad idea and explained several reasons why but then it said <code>IllegalArgumentException</code> would likely be more appropriate. This leaves me wondering the same question... What would lead me to decide to use <code>IllegalArgumentException</code> instead of <code>Exception</code> or <code>RuntimeException</code>.</p>\n"
