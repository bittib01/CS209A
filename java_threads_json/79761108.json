    "title": "Primitive types in patterns: why doesn&#39;t Integer dominate byte?",
    "body": "<p>JEP 455 introduced Primitive Types in Patterns, instanceof, and switch as a preview feature in JDK 23. It continues as a preview feature in JDK 24 and 25, so the feature is not detailed in the Java Language Specification.</p>\n<p>The JEP describes &quot;safety of conversions&quot;, where certain pairs of types are <em>unconditionally exact</em>, meaning no runtime checks are required.  For other pairs, a runtime test is necessary to determine if a conversion can be made without loss of information.</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<pre><code>int x = getValue();  // Which returns 42\n\nswitch (x) {\n  case byte -&gt; System.out.println(&quot;byte&quot;);\n  case int -&gt; System.out.println(&quot;int&quot;);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The runtime check verifies that 42 will fit in a byte and matches, printing 'byte'.</p>\n<p>If we change the order of the cases:</p>\n<pre><code>switch (x) {\n  case int -&gt; System.out.println(&quot;int&quot;);\n  case byte -&gt; System.out.println(&quot;byte&quot;);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will result in a compiler error because the int case now dominates the byte case.</p>\n<p>Quoting from the Java Language Specification (where pattern dominance is defined),</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A switch label in a switch block is said to be dominated if for every value that it\napplies to, it can be determined that one of the preceding switch labels would also\napply.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So far, everything makes sense.</p>\n<p>However, if we change the case for int to use the wrapper class Integer:</p>\n<pre><code>switch (x) {\n  case Integer -&gt; System.out.println(&quot;int&quot;);\n  case byte -&gt; System.out.println(&quot;byte&quot;);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This code will compile without an error, and the result will be 'int'.</p>\n<p>The compiler is clearly autoboxing the int to an Integer and matching the first case.</p>\n<p>What I can't understand is why the compiler allows this, since the Integer case is still dominating the byte case. Any value that will match for a byte will also match for a boxed Integer.</p>\n<p>JEP 507, the latest version states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Furthermore, boxing conversions and widening reference conversions are unconditionally exact.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, that still does not explain why the compiler is not rejecting this because of pattern dominance.</p>\n<p>Just to be clear, all the examples use the same line, <code>int x = getValue();</code>, where <code>getValue()</code> returns 42.</p>\n"
