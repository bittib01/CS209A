If it's the former, then what is the latter for?</p>\n<p>My impression is the body must be super-succinct, one or a few sentences long max, describing what it is. Any instructions for users of the class, are better suitted for <code>@apiNote</code>.</p>\n<p>However, many libraries put it in the body.</p>\n<p>What's your take?</p>\n"
