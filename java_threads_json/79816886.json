    "title": "Guideline for method ordering",
    "body": "<p>What's the best practice, preferably backed by a publicly available guideline issued by a tech company or a standards organization, when it comes to the order of method declarations in a Java source file?</p>\n<p>In particular, I'm interested in which should go first: private methods invoked from a constructor or public methods. One the one hand, it is advised, e.g. in Clean Code, to declare methods right after the first method from which it is first invoked.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In general we want function call dependencies to point in the downward direction. That is, a function that is called should be below a function that does the calling. This creates a nice flow down the source code module from high level to low level.</p>\n<p><em>Clean Code. Chapter 5, &quot;Formatting&quot;.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On the other hand, some say public methods should be declared first since one should be able to tell what a class does (not <em>how</em> it does it) at first glance at the source file. If a class is a GUI component, for example, initialization logic may be contained in a big number of private methods (e.g. <code>createContentPane()</code>, <code>createSubmitButton()</code>) which would pull any of its public methods way down if the latter have a lower priority.</p>\n<p>You may cite several guidelines if you wish.</p>\n<p>I haven't found it in <a href=\"https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Google Java Style Guide</a>, it just opts out.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The order you choose for the members and initializers of your class can have a great effect on learnability. However, there's no single correct recipe for how to do it; different classes may order their contents in different ways.</p>\n<p>What is important is that each class uses some logical order, which its maintainer could explain if asked.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Oracle's <a href=\"https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/codeconventions-fileorganization.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Code Conventions</a> are also not very specific.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>These methods should be grouped by functionality rather than by scope or accessibility. For example, a private class method can be in between two public instance methods. The goal is to make reading and understanding the code easier.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is essentially an opt-out too: even if I, as in my example, group initialization methods together, <em>where do I put that group</em>, before or after public methods?</p>\n<p>Note <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4668218/are-there-any-java-method-ordering-conventions\">this</a> doesn't answer my question.</p>\n"
