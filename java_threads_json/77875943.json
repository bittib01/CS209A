    "title": "How to solve an incompatibility issue related with the manifest file and b2bi software?",
    "body": "<p>I needed to implement a JMC project in Axway B2Bi software. I have followed the documentation, creating a component class, information class and a manifest file. I didn't find any syntax issue on my java code, however, it was not possible to implement the code. I think the problem might be related with the components of the manifest file that are not compatible with the b2bi conditions, but I have no idea how to solve that.</p>\n<p>My manifest file is similar to this:</p>\n<pre><code>Manifest-Version: 1.0\nMain-Class: com.axway.xib.samples.Sorter\nContainer-Version: 2.6-UP2023-10\nComponent-Version: 11.0.21\nClass-Path: ../lib/commons-lang3-3.14.0.jar ../lib/development-kit-api-1.3.0_R117682.jar ../lib/development-kit-runtime-1.3.0_R117682.jar ../lib/development-kit-simulator-1.3.0_R117682.jar ../lib/commons-beanutils-1.9.4.jar ../lib/commons-collections4-4.4.jar ../lib/commons-logging-1.3.0.jar\nBuild-Jdk: 11.0.21\n</code></pre>\n<p>According to the documentation <a href=\"https://docs.axway.com/bundle/B2Bi_26_UP2023-10_DeveloperGuide_JMC_allOS_en/resource/B2Bi_IntegrationEngine_JMC_DeveloperGuide.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">JMC</a>, the manifest file must look like that:</p>\n<pre><code>Manifest-Version: 1.0\nMain-Class: com.axway.xib.samples.Sorter\nContainer-Version: x1.x2\nComponent-Version: y1.y2\n\nWhere:\n Main-Class is the name of the principle JMC class\n x1.x2 corresponds to the chosen API version\n y1.y2 corresponds to the actual component version you are currently developing\n</code></pre>\n"
