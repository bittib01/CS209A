    "body": "<p>On the left side, there is a black color. I tried to find a way to remove it but I still can't. I tried switching the screen to the other side and it was the same, but it would switch to the other side, but it was at the front camera. I tried to open other apps and it was normal.</p>\n<p>I use this code and the navigation bar disappears but the camera doesn't.</p>\n<pre><code>  getWindow().getDecorView().setSystemUiVisibility(\n        View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_IMMERSIVE_STICKY\n        | View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_HIDE_NAVIGATION\n        | View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_FULLSCREEN\n        | View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LAYOUT_HIDE_NAVIGATION\n        | View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LAYOUT_FULLSCREEN\n        | View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LAYOUT_STABLE\n    );\n</code></pre>\n<p>I want to find a way to fix it so that the full screen hides all the black.</p>\n"
