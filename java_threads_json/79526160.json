    "title": "C2 Compiler is showing high value causing high CPU overhead #968",
    "body": "<p>We recently encountered an issue after upgrading to JDK 21 in our codebase, where CPU utilization for the Pod nearly doubled.</p>\n<p>Upon analyzing the thread dump, we identified that the C2 Compiler was running for over 500 seconds, which appears to be the primary cause of the spike. Below is an example:</p>\n<pre><code>&quot;C2 CompilerThread0&quot; #14 [452] daemon prio=9 os_prio=0 cpu=565781.78ms elapsed=20247.84s tid=0x00007dd95c1b4810 nid=452 waiting on condition [0x0000000000000000]\njava.lang.Thread.State: RUNNABLE\nNo compile task\n</code></pre>\n<p>We initially expected the JVM to optimize this over time and stabilize, but that didn’t happen.\nThe same code is working fine with Open JDK 17</p>\n<p>Has anyone else experienced a similar issue? Would appreciate any insights!</p>\n<p>How to debug this issue further ?</p>\n<p>Used <code>java -XX:+PrintCompilation -XX:+LogCompilation</code> but still could not able to figure out the problematic method</p>\n"
