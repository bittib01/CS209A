    "body": "<p>Can someone give me a hand with mapping this scenario? I tried adding a Salary table and reference to the Instructor just to scratch my curiosity, but only the Details table populates the instructor_id column. The Salary table shows null as the instructor_id, so it doesn't have a relation to the Instructor. How do I link both the details and the salary to the instructor using OneToOne relations? Here is what I tried. An explanation with the solution would be helpful as well. Thanks in advance.</p>\n<pre><code>@Entity(name = &quot;instructor&quot;)\n@Table(name = &quot;instructor&quot;)\npublic class Instructor {\n    @Id\n    @Column(name = &quot;id&quot;)\n    private int id;\n\n    @OneToOne(mappedBy= &quot;instructor&quot;, cascade = CascadeType.ALL)\n    @ToString.Exclude\n    private Details details;\n    \n    @OneToOne(mappedBy= &quot;instructor&quot;, cascade = CascadeType.ALL)\n    @ToString.Exclude\n    private Salary salary;\n}\n\n@Entity(name = &quot;details&quot;)\n@Table(name = &quot;details&quot;)\npublic class Details {\n    @Id\n    @Column(name = &quot;id&quot;)\n    private int id;\n\n    @JoinColumn(name = &quot;id&quot;)\n    @OneToOne\n    private Instructor instructor;\n}\n\n@Entity(name = &quot;salary&quot;)\n@Table(name = &quot;salary&quot;)\npublic class Salary {\n    @Id\n    @Column(name = &quot;id&quot;)\n    private int id;\n\n    @JoinColumn(name = &quot;id&quot;)\n    @OneToOne\n    private Instructor instructor;\n}\n\n\n      \n</code></pre>\n"
