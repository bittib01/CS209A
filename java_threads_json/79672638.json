    "body": "<p>I'm developing a javafx application for a university project.\nHowever, I realized that <strong>I can't create truly responsive applications without being able to change the order of my elements on the scene</strong>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/xy2NQqiI.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/xy2NQqiI.png\" alt=\"example image\" /></a></p>\n<p>In this case, when the screen is small (think of a cell phone) I would like the logo to appear at the top of the form, and not on its left. However, nothing like this exists on the net, except with archaic and not very elegant mechanisms.</p>\n<p>I trust that there is simply no documentation, and that a mechanism to do this exists.\nThe example I'm giving you is only to make you understand the question I'm asking myself, the applications are large and go far beyond my stupid login screen: <strong>is it possible that javafx doesn't allow in a not too articulated way to create a truly responsive design?</strong></p>\n"
