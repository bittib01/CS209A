    "body": "<p>I have installed an Android emulator, where I have my application's APK installed (I can't disclose the APK name as it belongs to the IT company where I work).\nI have successfully established a connection between JMeter, running locally, and the Android emulator. I followed all the necessary steps and I am able to record the traffic from the mobile browser (e.g., Chrome).\nHowever, when I try to record the mobile application, I encounter the following error screen.\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/WxrNbygw.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mobile application error screen</a></p>\n<p>Do I need to follow additional steps in order to record the traffic of mobile apk.\nCan someone please guide me.\nThank you.</p>\n<p>I have tried adding Jmeter rootCA certificate in wifi additional settings window.\nAlso added the certificate in security/privacy tab in android settings</p>\n"
