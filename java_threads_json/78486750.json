    "title": "Eclipse does not open after it is installed",
    "body": "<p>So basically I installed the latest version of eclipse (The &quot;Eclipse IDE for Java Developers&quot; specifically) on Windows 10</p>\n<p>It only opens once from the installer. From that it runs fine, I even made a working program on it.\nHowever, once I close it does not open again</p>\n<p>All that happens when I try to open it is the little loading window that says eclipse pops up for a second and then closes</p>\n<p>I checked task manager and there's nothing about eclipse before or after I try to launch it</p>\n<p>After everything I've tried it still only works once from the installer immediately after I install it, and I'd rather not have to reinstall it every time I try to launch it</p>\n<p>I tried restarting the computer and reinstalling it a few times and choosing some different options with each attempt but still the same thing happens</p>\n<p>I also updated my version of the JDK</p>\n<p>I even gave up at one point and tried to install it on another computer which has Windows 11 and the exact same thing happens. Is it possible that there is a conflict with another application I have?</p>\n<p>I have even followed tutorials on how to install it properly but it still refuses to work. I am clearly doing something wrong, since it does not work on either computer, but I just do not understand.</p>\n<p>I have spent about 2 days trying to figure this out now and I have not come up with anything</p>\n<p>Any help or suggestions would be hugely appreciated!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>(edit)</p>\n<p>The version of eclipse I am trying to use is the Java 2024-03 (4.31) version. (from <a href=\"https://eclipseide.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://eclipseide.org/</a>)</p>\n<p>Here is a screenshot I got of the window that pops up:\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/YjRKcCMx.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eclipse IDE 2024 03</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>If there is anything I did not include or clarify well enough please let me know, thanks!</li>\n</ul>\n"
