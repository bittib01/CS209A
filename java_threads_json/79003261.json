    "body": "<p>I'm working with <em><a href=\"https://fabricmc.net/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Minecraft Fabric</a></em> 1.21.1 and I need to send data from the client to the server. Could anyone provide guidance on the correct way to accomplish this? I understand that I need to use Fabric's networking system, but I am unsure of the exact method or approach.</p>\n<p>Specifically, I'm looking for:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>How to create and send a packet from the client to the server.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Any specific classes or methods that should be used in Fabric 1.21.1.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>I would appreciate any advice or references to documentation or examples.</p>\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n<p>I attempted to use ClientPlayNetworking.send() with a CustomPayload in Minecraft Fabric 1.21.1 to send data from the client to the server. I created a PacketByteBuf to hold the data and tried sending it using ClientPlayNetworking.send() with an Identifier and the buffer. However, I encountered errors related to type mismatches and the creation of CustomPayload.</p>\n"
