    "title": "How to efficiently find the smallest missing positive integer in a large, partially sorted array?",
    "body": "<p>I have a large array of integers that is partially sorted, meaning that some parts of the array are in order, but others are not. I need to find the smallest missing positive integer (greater than 0) in this array efficiently without fully sorting the entire array.</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<p>Input:\narr = [3, -1, 4, 1, 5, 0, 2]</p>\n<p>Expected Output:\n6 (as 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are present, but 6 is the smallest missing positive integer).</p>\n<p>I wrote the following Java code using a HashSet to track the presence of numbers and then looped through to find the smallest missing positive integer:</p>\n<pre><code>import java.util.HashSet;\n\npublic class SmallestMissingPositive {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int[] arr = {3, -1, 4, 1, 5, 0, 2};\n                System.out.println(findSmallestMissingPositive(arr));\n    }\n    \n    public static int findSmallestMissingPositive(int[] arr) {\n        HashSet&lt;Integer&gt; seen = new HashSet&lt;&gt;();\n        for (int num : arr) {\n            if (num &gt; 0) {\n                seen.add(num);\n            }\n        }\n    \n        int smallestMissing = 1;\n        while (seen.contains(smallestMissing)) {\n            smallestMissing++;\n        }\n    \n        return smallestMissing;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This code works but isn’t optimal for very large arrays. I want to optimize it further, potentially without using additional space (e.g., by modifying the input array itself).</p>\n<p>My Questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Is there a way to solve this problem in O(n) time complexity without additional space?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>How can I leverage the partially sorted nature of the array to improve performance?</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n"
