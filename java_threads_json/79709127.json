    "body": "<p>I often see both terms — <strong>JMM (Java Memory Model)</strong> and <strong>JVM (Java Virtual Machine)</strong> — when learning about multithreading and memory management in Java. However, I'm confused about how they relate to each other and what their responsibilities are.</p>\n<p>From what I understand:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>The <strong>JVM</strong> is the engine that runs Java bytecode.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The <strong>JMM</strong> defines how variables are read and written in a concurrent environment.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But I'm still unclear on:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Does the JMM exist within the JVM or is it just a specification?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>How does the JMM affect how the JVM works on different hardware?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Can the JVM implementation affect how the JMM behaves?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Is it possible for two JVMs to behave differently with regards to JMM?</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Could someone clarify this with a concise explanation (or a practical example if possible)?</p>\n"
