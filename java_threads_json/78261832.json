    "body": "<p>I want to save a <code>Hashmap</code> to a file:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>public static Map&lt;Player, Integer&gt; seconds = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();\n</code></pre>\n<p>It is to keep track of an integer given to a player, more specifically a timer.\nThis is all working, but when the player leaves, the data is lost which is an issue.</p>\n<p>I don't mind how it is saved, I just need it to be saved on player quit and retrieved when the player joins.</p>\n<p>P.S. I am new to plugin development (and Java I guess), and I really have done as much research as possible but no luck with this problem.</p>\n<p>I tried countless methods, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Saving to JSON with GSON (and other methods)</li>\n<li>I Looked into the <code>Serializable</code> class.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I wanted the file to be saved somewhere in the server.\nWhen a player leaves, the current <code>Integer</code> value must be saved to the <code>Player</code>.\nWhen a player joins, the <code>Player</code>'s <code>Integer</code> will load and resume where it left off.</p>\n"
