    "title": "evenSum method takes too long to execute in edge cases, how can I optimize the loop?",
    "body": "<p>I am working on a Java method called evenSum that sums all even numbers between two integers, from and to, inclusive. The requirements specify that if from is greater than to, the method should return -1. For example, <code>evenSum(4, 6)</code> should return 10, <code>evenSum(10, 15)</code> should return 36, and <code>evenSum(4, 4)</code> should return 4.</p>\n<p>Although the method works for many cases, it fails test 8 due to performance issues, taking too long to execute. The test output suggests that the loop conditions might be inefficient.</p>\n<p>The method currently checks if from is odd and increments it to the next even number, then sums even numbers in a loop until it reaches to. I suspect the loop is not optimized, especially for larger ranges.</p>\n<p>I would appreciate any suggestions for improving the efficiency of my code to prevent timing out during tests. Initially, I expected the method to calculate the sum correctly for various input ranges, including edge cases. While it passed the first seven tests, it failed test 8 unexpectedly, leading me to believe there may be an inefficiency in the loop.</p>\n<p>My code:</p>\n<pre><code>public static long evenSum(int from, int to) {\n    if (from &gt; to) {\n        return -1L;\n    }\n\n    if (from % 2 != 0) {\n        from++;\n    }\n\n    long sum = 0L;\n    int currentValue = from;\n\n    while (currentValue &lt;= to) {\n        sum += currentValue;\n        currentValue += 2; \n    }\n\n    return sum;\n}\n</code></pre>\n"
