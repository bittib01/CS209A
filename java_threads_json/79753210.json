    "body": "<p>I have a web application which uses okta oauth2 with authorization_code grant types, SSO is also configured for the same enterprise okta auth server.\nI want to expose some APIs from the same web app, API consumers will be using client_credentials grant type while accessing those APIs.</p>\n<p>Is it possible to use two grant types, authorization_code and client_credentials in the same application?  If yes then how to configure spring security for having two grant types? Or I have to create a separate application for APIs which will have a separate authorization server and client_ids.</p>\n"
