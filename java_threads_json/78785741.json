    "title": "M2E in Eclipse (Maven Integration): how to see actual Maven output and customize builds?",
    "body": "<p>I might be missing something fundamental here, but if I need to debug a Maven Project in Eclipse, I'm used to simply select Project -&gt; Clean or Build Project, then look to the Errors view to find and fix all the issues and then debug. But I never saw actual Maven build output of m2eclipse (M2E), like how it downloads dependencies, compiles modules, etc. How can I see that? Also, how can I customize such a build, like by adding a custom variable or specifying custom location for settings.xml using --settings flag?</p>\n<p>I know I can &quot;run&quot; a pom.xml as Maven build and specify various parameters, but doing so does not affect the errors list, i.e. it does not seem to be the same as &quot;Project -&gt; Clean...&quot;, so I can't debug an app that way. I also know I can chose a global/user settings.xml file from preferences, but I need a project-specific one.</p>\n<p>I have found some info on that on the <a href=\"https://eclipse.dev/m2e/documentation/m2e-faq.html#how-to-retrieve-an-actual-command-line-used-to-start-jvm-and-maven\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">m2eclipse FAQ page</a>, but it seems to be for running apps, not compiling. Also, it's confusing because images don't show up in that article.</p>\n<p>FYI: I posted similar question in <a href=\"https://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php/m/1867476/#msg_1867476\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eclipse Community Forums</a>, but nobody responded for a long time, so added it here.</p>\n<p>Thank you in advance.</p>\n"
