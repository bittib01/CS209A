    "title": "Is it possible to get both Multipart file and a RequestBody in springboot?",
    "body": "<p>I want to have a post method in Springboot which will post data to database where I've a table which holds data of an employee and that includes resume as well. I want to have resume as a document hence I had byte[] on the entity class. I passed the document as Multipart/form-data from the postman and had the requestBody in the raw body section as JSON data. But couldn't do so.</p>\n<p>I passed the document as Multipart/form-data from the postman and had the requestBody in the raw body section as JSON data with the controller written like,</p>\n<pre><code>@PostMapping()\npublic ResponseEntity&lt;EmployeeMinimalResponseDTO&gt; postEmployee(\n            @RequestPart(value = &quot;resume&quot;) MultipartFile file,\n            @RequestBody(required = false) EmployeeDTO employeeDTO) throws IOException {\n     Employee employee = Converters.getEmployeeFromEmployeeDto(employeeDTO);\n     employee.setResume(file.getBytes());\n     return this.employeeService.postEmployee(employee);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>leads to an Internal Server Error saying 'Current request is not a multipart request'. What am I doing wrong ? Do I have to do any kind of configuration to make it work. I had [starter web, Data JPA, mysql Connector, Lombok] dependencies.</p>\n<p>Here is my Application.properties,</p>\n<pre><code>spring.servlet.multipart.enabled=true\nspring.servlet.multipart.file-size-threshold=2KB\nspring.servlet.multipart.max-file-size=5MB\nspring.servlet.multipart.max-request-size=7MB\n</code></pre>\n<p>followed by mysql configuration.</p>\n<p>But, I had a controller to check the Multipart upload alone and that works fine like,</p>\n<pre><code>@PostMapping(&quot;check&quot;)\n    public String fileUploadCheck(@RequestPart(value = &quot;resume&quot;,required = false) MultipartFile file) throws IOException{\n        Employee employee= new Employee();\n        employee.setResume(file.getBytes());\n        this.employeeService.postEmployee(employee);\n        return &quot;file uploaded successfullly..&quot;;\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>which happily returns, &quot;file uploaded successfullly..&quot; I don't know why. Can anyone help me on this. Thanks in advance :)</p>\n"
