    "body": "<p>I’m using Stripe’s API to create two subscriptions for the same customer, and I need both to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have the same billing cycle date.</li>\n<li>Generate invoices at the exact same time (it's related I believe to my previous bullet).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I've tried setting the <code>billing_cycle_anchor</code> of the second subscription to match the first one's period end date. The subscriptions are created on different days rather than simultaneously.</p>\n<pre><code>builder = builder.setBillingCycleAnchor(new Date(firstSubscription.getCurrentPeriodEnd() * 1000).toInstant().getEpochSecond());\n</code></pre>\n<p>Despite these efforts, there's a slight delay in invoice creation. It's odd because the first set of invoices in December had the same creation date, but the subsequent pairs in January and February were created a day apart (as shown in the screenshot below).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/5u94lCHO.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/5u94lCHO.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>My only hunch is that it might be related to timezones — for example, if the subscription's billing cycle is close to midnight UTC.</p>\n"
