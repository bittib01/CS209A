    "body": "<p>In my MongoDB collection I have a documents that follow a parent-child structure.</p>\n<p>Each parent doc typically has 4 fields, with the children having 3 (no group field).</p>\n<p><strong>parent:</strong></p>\n<pre><code>{\n_id: doc_123\nparent_id: 123\nactive: true\ngroup: A\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>children</strong></p>\n<pre><code>{\nid: doc_123_1\nparent_id: 123\nactive: true\n}\n\n{\nid: doc_123_2\nparent_id: 123\nactive: true\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I want to write a BSON query / aggregation if needed for my Java Spring project that will return all the docs that match the following fields provided by user:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>active field - this will be true or false</li>\n<li>group field - e.g &quot;A&quot;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>My difficulty is that each child document is assumed to have the same value as the parent for the group field, but it is not actually in the document.</p>\n<p>How can I write a query that will match all the parent and child documents for a certain group?</p>\n<p>All documents are in the one collection, there are no separate collections for parent and child docs.</p>\n"
