    "title": "Newer easier ways to interact with the console in Java 25+? What is IO.println()?",
    "body": "<p>I have seen mentions of new classes and methods for interacting with a console in a Java app. Like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You shouldn't use <code>Scanner</code> at all, really. It's not meant for keyboard input, and it has bizarre API. In that the API does exactly what its spec says, but if you think 'Scanner - that's the keyboard, right?' the spec of scanner is bizarre. See the usual confusion about mixing <code>nextLine</code> and <code>nextInt</code> for example. There is no good replacement right now yet, but there will be soon: <code>java.io.IO</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I cannot find a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JDK_Enhancement_Proposal\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Java JEP</a> for these new features on the <a href=\"https://openjdk.org/jeps/0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">JEP index</a>.</p>\n"
