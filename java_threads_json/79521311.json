    "body": "<p>We need to implement a cache in Spring Boot 3 that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Load data on the first call to a method.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Update the cache periodically with configurable times per method.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Perform asynchronous updates of the cache with what we have configured in the application.yml.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If we make a request and it has not yet been completely refreshed, it should show the old cache.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Can you propose me an example of a framework that facilitates this management?</p>\n<p>I have been looking for the native asynchronous refresh part but it has not worked for me.</p>\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n"
