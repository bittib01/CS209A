    "body": "<p>In a system where the DB data is updated constantly by backend scheduled jobs (DB scheduled jobs). What's the best approach to implement real-time data caching in a Java application?</p>\n<p>Tried with Redis or Ignite cache, but they mostly deal with data processed through the application. But Redis or Ignite wouldn't know of the update when the data is updated constantly from the backend DB job. How will you update or refresh the cache if it is not just a few records but multiple records in multiple tables?</p>\n"
