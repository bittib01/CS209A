    "title": "Combining Spring Boot JPA with entity graph",
    "body": "<p>I am using Spring Boot JPA to pull employee details. My employee entity looks like below:</p>\n<pre><code>Employee.java\npublic class Employee {\n   private String id;\n   private String name;\n   @ManyToOne\n   @JoinColumn(name = &quot;DEPT_ID&quot;, referencedColumnName = &quot;DEPT_ID&quot;)\n   private Department department;\n   @ManyToOne\n   @JoinColumn(name = &quot;ADD_ID&quot;, referencedColumnName = &quot;ADD_ID&quot;)\n   private Address address;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>In Employee Repo, when I tried <code>List&lt;Employee&gt; findAll()</code> method, it goes into N+1 problem and to tackle it, I tried with Entity Graph, which solved the issue. But my repository method looks like below,</p>\n<pre><code>@EntityGraph(attributePaths = {&quot;department&quot;, &quot;address&quot;})\nList&lt;Employee&gt; findByDepartmentActiveIndOrderByAddressCity(String activeInd);\n</code></pre>\n<p>with above repository method I am able to achieve what is required but the method name is big. Is there way to combine entity graph and Jpa specification. I tried basic JPA Specification joining Department and Address entities but it gives me N+1 issue. Is there a better approach or is there a way to combine entity graph with specification?</p>\n"
