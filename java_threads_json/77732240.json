    "title": "BlueCove library is not supported for Android",
    "body": "<p>I connected to a Bluetooth device using the BlueCove library in a non-Android Java project. It works fine when testing on Windows, but when I test it on an Android device, I get the following error.</p>\n<pre><code>BlueCove com.intel.bluetooth.BluetoothStackBlueZ|com.intel.bluetooth.BluetoothStackBlueZDBus not available\n</code></pre>\n<p>I took the java project I prepared to test on the Android device as a jar file and integrated it into the other mobile project.\nAs a result of my research on the internet, I saw that android devices do not support the BlueCove library. I learned that there is no common Bluetooth library in Android and non-Android Java. How do you think I can solve this problem?</p>\n"
