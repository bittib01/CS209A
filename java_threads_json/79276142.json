    "title": "How does &quot;hot code replace&quot; in Eclipse work and what restrictions or limitations are there in using this?",
    "body": "<p>I work on debuggers, such as one for Python. My friends who use Eclipse to debug Java tell me that there is a very useful feature that Eclipse (and similar Java IDE's?) called &quot;hot code replace&quot; - if you edit a source file and save it while debugging a method, it will replace the (executing) code and restart the top most method.</p>\n<p>I would like to be able to understand at a technical level a little bit about how this works, what the Java Runtime system provides to make this possible, and what restrictions or limitations there are for being able to do this.</p>\n<p>For example, @howlger in the comments below informs that it &quot;...only works when the class signature does not change; you cannot remove or add fields to existing classes, for instance.&quot;</p>\n<p>Are there any other other restrictions?</p>\n"
