    "body": "<p>I was originally using <code>@Select</code> in my interface for my sql queries in the interface file and have added <code>@MapperScan</code> above my SpringApplication class.\n<br> But my sql query is now huge and I am getting <code>&quot;&lt;script&gt;SELECT ...&quot; is too long for constant pool</code> <br>\nAfter which I tried to move the query to xml file but when I do that I get <code>Invalid bound statement (not found) </code>.\n<br>\nI tried adding <code>mybatis.mapper-locations</code> in my applications.properties but still getting the same error. <br>\nI now have my SQL queries in both Java file and XML file and want to use both for mapping. <br>\nDoes anyone know how to solve it?</p>\n"
