    "body": "<p>When I run <code>spring-boot:build-image</code> in a Spring Boot project, I notice that the container build script downloads something called BellSoft Liberica JRE:</p>\n<pre><code>[INFO]     [creator]       BellSoft Liberica JRE 21.0.4: Contributing to layer                                                                                                                 \n[INFO]     [creator]         Downloading from https://github.com/bell-sw/Liberica/releases/download/21.0.4+9/bellsoft-jre21.0.4+9-linux-amd64.tar.gz\n</code></pre>\n<p>I have never heard of this company to be honest. What does Spring use this strange JRE distribution instead of something like Eclipse Temurin, which also has Docker images for all Java versions?</p>\n<p>The reason I'm asking is that if often fails to download and just caught my attention. I'm just curious what is the advantage of using  JRE builds from this company.</p>\n"
