    "body": "<p>I am developing a gym application, consisting of two separate apps: one for administrators and another for members. User registration is facilitated through Google Firebase authentication using email and password. Today, I noticed an error message on my project panel regarding cross-origin redirect sign-ins.</p>\n<p>Currently, I do not utilize any sign-in or sign-in with Facebook options on the login pages of either app, and both apps are connected to a single Firebase project. Should I disregard this message since my login process does not involve redirects from other websites, or is it necessary to implement changes to comply with the new policies?</p>\n"
