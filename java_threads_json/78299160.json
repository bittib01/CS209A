    "title": "Java - How to get Windows network drive full path from drive letter",
    "body": "<p>In Java, I've created a program for internal users to create mappings in our database to locations on our network drives. I'm doing this by getting a java.io.File object from a javax.swing JFileChooser.</p>\n<p>The problem is once I have the File object, the Strings returned by getAbsolutePath &amp; getCanonicalPath contain the local drive letter (e.g. N:\\myDir\\myFile.dat) when I need the full drive path (e.g. \\\\shared-drive\\..\\myDir\\myFile.dat).</p>\n<p>I'd prefer a native Java solution but I'm not opposed to using external libraries as long as I can build from the source.</p>\n<p>I tried using the getSystemDisplayName method from javax.swing FileSystemView, it did not seem to return the correct result.</p>\n"
