    "title": "Accessibility permission features not working on android 15",
    "body": "<p>I am building an app(expo react native ts with custom native code in the android folder) that uses android's accessibility service/feature to read what is on the screen, and it's triggered by events from a certain app. On my android 13 device the service is working perfectly and able to read all accessibility events, while on android 15 it does not, and ir only reads some events. I test with npx expo run:android and works fine with android 13 devices, but not on 15. I even tried putting the release build on google play for internal testing(since android doesn't let sideloaded apps from accessing its accessibility services) and installed it there and still did not work.</p>\n"
