    "body": "<p>Whilst migrating to Java 17, I tried to include an external Xerces dependency, following the JEP-403 recommendation. JEP-403 explicitly states the following under &quot;Risks and Assumptions&quot;:</p>\n<p>&quot;Code that uses the JDK’s internal copy of the Xerces XML processor. Such code should instead use a standalone copy of the Xerces library, available from Maven Central.&quot; (otherwise, such code might fail) <a href=\"https://openjdk.org/jeps/403\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://openjdk.org/jeps/403</a></p>\n<p>However, after including Xerces2 version 2.12.2, two of the properties used by our SAXParser are not supported anymore, namely ACCESS_EXTERNAL_DTD and ACCESS_EXTERNAL_SCHEMA.</p>\n<p>This is a known issue and most solutions I found suggest to either exclude the external Xerces (when it's brought in as a transitive dependency) or to use the on-board JDK version.</p>\n<p>Is there a better solution that is in line with the JEP-403 recommendation?</p>\n"
