    "title": "Unable to set system properties from IntelliJ run configuration for a gradle task",
    "body": "<p>I'm using IntelliJ 2024.3.3 Ultimate edition; more precisely I'm doing remote development. I have an application where the test execution for local environment requires a custom system property to be set. The project is using gradle and the gradle.file cannot be changed!</p>\n<p>I tried literally everything for IntelliJ to set me a system property from JAVA_OPTS to JAVA_OPTIONS till VM options, System.getProperty(&quot;...&quot;) returns null every single time.</p>\n<p>I tried adding JAVA_OPTS=&quot;-Dmy.awesome.property=plswork&quot; to the environment variables in the run configuration for the integrationTest gradle task, to no avail.</p>\n<p>I tried the same with JAVA_OPTIONS but the outcome was the same.\nI tried adding &quot;-Dmy.awesome.property=plswork&quot; to VM options just to come back to the same conclusion.</p>\n<pre><code>var systemProperties = System.getProperties();\nif (!systemProperties.containsKey(OVERRIDE)) {\n    // always the case...\n} else {\n    // I actually want this!\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Override is:</p>\n<pre><code>private static final String OVERRIDE = &quot;my.awesome.property&quot;;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Running the Gradle task outside IntelliJ works perfectly fine and obviously without the override it also works just fine. How on earth one can configure a system property for a single very specific Gradle task (I only need this property for this very specific integrationTest task, none else!) while using IntelliJ?</p>\n<p>What am I missing? I already went through some similar questions and tested all applicable solutions, to no avail. Modifying the integration.gradle file might work, but I cannot do that as that comes from a different repo through submodules and an update will affect loads of other projects (not to mention it's not my team who manages that).</p>\n"
