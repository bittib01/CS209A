    "title": "Difference in character-set reading from command line",
    "body": "<p>I am trying to compile/convert a Java program that I wrote from using the &quot;normal&quot; JDK (Java v24) to natively compiled code using the GraalVM (v25). The &quot;classic&quot; version runs fine. The native version starts up OK but then it has an issue with program arguments read-in from the command-line which are apparently in a different character set than the ones being used by the original Java application (or the filename are being dealt with differently).</p>\n<p>The issue is triggerend by passing a filename-argument to the application (via drag-and-drop) that contains Umlauts. Both program variants echo the passed-in filename (actually the full file-path) as:</p>\n<pre><code>U:\\Documents\\Kontoauszï¿½ge\\...\\Umsatzï¿½bersicht_20250401-20250831.csv\n</code></pre>\n<p>i.e. also in the classic version the filename echoed on the console seems &quot;garbled&quot; (the <code>ï¿½</code> is actually an <code>ü</code> in the file system), but the classic Java version finds, opens and processes that file without any issue. The GraalVM's compiled native executable echoes the very same filename also &quot;garbled&quot; but then throws a FileNotFound-Exception:</p>\n<pre><code>java.io.FileNotFoundException: U:\\Documents\\Kontoauszï¿½ge\\...\\Umsatzï¿½bersicht_20250401-20250831_AT221600000100586916.csv (The system cannot find the path specified)\n</code></pre>\n<p>(Note: I left out irrelevant fractions of the path here for privacy reason and replaced them with <code>...</code>).</p>\n<p>Why is this name/path handling behavior is different? Is there an option to align the command-line character set used by the GraalVM generated native's code's with the character set being used by the JDK-based &quot;vanilla&quot; Java code?</p>\n<p><strong>Later addition - answering misc. questions:</strong></p>\n<p>This is on Windows 10 (all current fixes/patches/updates installed).\nNo &quot;VM&quot; other than the Java VM is involved here. The actual filename/path is <code>U:\\Documents\\Kontoauszüge\\...\\Umsatzübersicht_20250401-20250831.csv</code>\n(the <code>...</code>-part of the path does not contain any Umlauts or other special characters).</p>\n<pre><code>C:\\&gt;chcp\nActive code page: 437\n</code></pre>\n<p>My Windows system region settings are &quot;English (Switzerland)&quot; (yes - that exists). The system's display language is &quot;English (US)&quot;.</p>\n<p>The drag-and-drop I mentioned is via the Windwos Explorer, the &quot;GUI&quot; that some respondents wanted to know about is the Windows desktop. I drag the file that I want to be processed over a command-file which then calls the java application passing the argument via <code>%1</code> to the command line calling the java application (or the .exe in the GraalVM case).</p>\n"
