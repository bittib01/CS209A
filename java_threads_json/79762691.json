    "title": "Java Batch ItemProcessor lifecycle missing?",
    "body": "<p>An <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/batch/api/chunk/ItemProcessor.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ItemProcessor</a>, as defined by Java Batch contains only one method: <code>processItem(Object item)</code></p>\n<p>What I am missing are lifecycle events like <code>open()</code> and <code>close()</code> - similar to the methods on ItemReader or ItemWriter. I mimicked <code>open()</code> where <code>processItem(item)</code> will detect it is called for the first time and trigger a call to my open method.</p>\n<p>But as close() is still missing I notice more complex ItemProcessors that need to cleanup after use have no chance of doing so. I tried to add the interface <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/batch/api/chunk/listener/ChunkListener.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ChunkListener</a> to benefit from the <code>afterChunk()</code> method, but at least in JBeret and BatchEE implementations that method is not called on a chunk's processor. It is the same for StepListener. Registering the ItemProcessor as Listener will just create another instance of the same class and cleanup will fail again.</p>\n<p>Also I tried to use the <code>finalize()</code> method, but that seems not sufficient/reliable either.</p>\n<p>If ItemProcessor is not intended to cleanup after use, how would I have to design the application such that complex decisions (which may require to connect to other systems like database) can be taken?</p>\n"
