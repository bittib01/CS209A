    "body": "<p>I'm trying to make an app that protect android device from phishing app in which users have applied permission by accident.<br>\nThe app detects camera activation by other app,\nand it deactivate the camera if the camera is activated by other app.</p>\n<p><strong>So is there a way to know if the camera is on?\nand is there a way to disable the camera?</strong></p>\n<p>I found <code>CameraManager.AvailabilityCallback</code>, but I am not sure if it is available in current versions.</p>\n<p>Also I tried to find a way to disable camera but could not find it.</p>\n<p>Also there are some camera block apps like &quot;Camera Block: Guard &amp; Anti spy&quot; by BytePioneers where it stops camera before an app tries to use it. I am curious how this kind of app work.</p>\n"
