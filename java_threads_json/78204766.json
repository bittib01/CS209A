    "body": "<p>How can I catch JS Eror messages using the automatic driver that comes with Selenium 4? And in order to use this in all my tests, should I define the test in @AfterEach? Or can everything be recorded automatically with a test class we wrote? What do I need to do in Junit5 to store incoming reports?I am sharing the driver class I use with you in case it may contribute to the solution.<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/L4BkA.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">enter image description here</a> Thank you for all your help, good work</p>\n<p>When I examined the previous answers to similar problems, I saw that these solutions were for before selenium4. For example, I know that there is no need to define drivers separately with Selenium4. I think that's why I failed when I tried to apply the previous methods.When I examined the previous answers to similar problems, I saw that these solutions were for before selenium4.
