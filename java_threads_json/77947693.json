    "body": "<p>In our production clusters we see a pattern over 14 days flink CPU climbs up resulting in container kill.</p>\n<p>Flink heap shows a growth as shown in the graph below. The initial theory is CPU is contributed due to this increased heap growth (More GC activity/ Object allocation and deallocations).</p>\n<p>Please suggest efficient ways to resolve and narrow down the issue.</p>\n<p>If this is contributed by application code what are the efficient tools to exactly narrow down where the issue is ?</p>\n<p>We are not using any checkpointing features.</p>\n<p>Thanks a lot!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ugQ9b.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ugQ9b.jpg\" alt=\"Heap Growth\" /></a></p>\n<p>Used GCViewer and observed gc activity is more compared to day 1 and day 10.</p>\n"
