    "title": "How to serialize/deserialize JMH result to compare baseline with feature code",
    "body": "<p>My requirement:\nI want to execute JMH tests that will benchmark the performance of my code baseline, save the results in a file and upload to a server.\nWhen the same test is executed from a feature branch on the CI, this file will be read and current result will be compared to the result of baseline, and fail if it is longer than a predefined threshold.</p>\n<p>Is there a way/class to serialise the result of a JMH test result, that can be deserialized easily ?\nI know I can output multiple <a href=\"https://github.com/openjdk/jmh/tree/master/jmh-core/src/main/java/org/openjdk/jmh/results/format\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">formats</a>, but I did not find any Utility class that allows me to deserialize/parse those formats directly.</p>\n<p>Note: I know I can just get a specific number of the result object and persist only that as a double object, but I want the whole result that contains multiple different statistics so I can play with them and do a more complete comparison. That is why I am looking for a way to persist the whole result object.</p>\n<p>Any help is appreciated, and thanks in advance !</p>\n<p>I have already checked this <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29091248/is-it-possible-to-use-jmh-as-a-maven-validation-check\">question</a>, the logic is the same but there is no answer for the implementation details.</p>\n"
