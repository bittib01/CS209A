    "body": "<p>I have been tasked to upgrade a Java project, and now in the Hibernate package, there was a function <code>dialect.getTypeName()</code> but now it is giving me undefined after upgrading to version 6.6.6. I don't want to go back I need alternatives.</p>\n<p>Below is my function call</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>dialect.getTypeName(-16, 255, 0, 0)\n</code></pre>\n<p>I am getting error getTypeName is not defined. I have searched and have found that it has been moved to <code>Jdbc</code>, but I could not found any way what will do the exact same thing the above code can.</p>\n"
