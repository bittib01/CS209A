    "title": "Reading from STDIN via BufferedReader in while loop - Array only correct if System.out.println() is called within the loop",
    "body": "<p>I have this basic mechanism for loading STDIN into an array via BufferedReader and a while loop:</p>\n<pre><code>BufferedReader r = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));        \nint lineCount = 0;\nString[] titles = new String[50000];    //File never has more than 50000 lines\nwhile(r.ready()) {\n    \n    // Reading data using readLine and store in titles array\n    String s = r.readLine();\n    titles[lineCount++] = s;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>When accessing the finished 'titles' array outside the while loop after this, it appears about half of the indexes are null. However, if I include a <code>System.out.println()</code> call within the loop, the finished array is fully populated as expected.</p>\n<pre><code>BufferedReader r = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));        \nint lineCount = 0;\nString[] titles = new String[50000];    //File never has more than 50000 lines\nwhile(r.ready()) {\n    \n    // Reading data using readLine and store in titles array\n    String s = r.readLine();\n    System.out.println(titles[lineCount-1] + &quot; &quot; + (lineCount - 1));\n    titles[lineCount++] = s;\n    \n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I gotta be missing something easy here, right? There's no threading involved. I've tried calling <code>System.out.flush()</code> instead of <code>println</code>, but that doesn't do the trick. Why is <code>println</code> seemingly required to get all lines correctly assigned to the array? (Again, only some and not all array indexes are null without the <code>println</code> statement within the loop.)</p>\n"
