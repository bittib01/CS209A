    "body": "<p>[\nI am migrating my project to support Android 15, updating both the target SDK and compile SDK to 35. After upgrading to AGP 8.8.1 and Kotlin 2.0, we noticed an increase of ~2.4 MB in the release APK size.</p>\n<p>Upon inspection, it appears that a specific folder androidx.compose.** is no longer being obfuscated by R8/ProGuard. This results in larger class/method names and potentially unused code being retained.]</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/jyAVn01F.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/jyAVn01F.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<pre><code>    release {\n    minifyEnabled true\n    debuggable false\n    shrinkResources true\n    proguardFiles proguard-rules.pro\n}\n\n\n    proguard-rules.pro is empty \n</code></pre>\n<p>In older apk with AGP &lt; 7 , Kotlin 1.9.0, target SDK 34 it is working as expected.</p>\n<p>Let me know if you need more details ?</p>\n"
