    "title": "How to exclude calls that are being done inside a logger when using PIT Mutation Testing?",
    "body": "<p>I'm using PIT mutation testing in a Java project (version 21), and I'm facing an issue regarding the exclusion of log calls from the mutation process.</p>\n<p>In my codebase, I have several log statements that I don't want to cover with unit tests, some of which contain method calls to retrieve data. For example, I have log statements like this example:</p>\n<pre><code>log.info(&quot;Id={}, name={}&quot;, foo.getId(), foo.getName())\n</code></pre>\n<p>All my classes and lines are covered (with mutants killed) in the project except for these log files, that are reporting surviving mutants:</p>\n<pre><code>1. removed call to com/project/Foo::getId → SURVIVED\n2. removed call to com/project/Foo::getName → SURVIVED\n</code></pre>\n<p>I want to configure PIT to exclude any method calls within the logger from the mutation process. However, I still want PIT to evaluate the rest of the codebase for mutations.</p>\n<p>Is there a way to achieve this with PIT? I've looked into using exclusion configurations in the official documentation, stackoverflow and PIT dev chats, but I couldn't find a way to specifically exclude method calls within log statements.</p>\n<p>Any help or guidance on how to configure PIT to exclude the log method calls from mutation testing would be greatly appreciated.</p>\n<p>I have tried with configurations in the pom like avoidCallsTo (avoinding call to logger interfaces) and with the feature +FLOGCALL, but this is only preventing mutants to be created for basic logs, it is still evaluating the methods that are inside these log methods.</p>\n"
