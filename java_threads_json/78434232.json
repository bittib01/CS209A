    "body": "<p>I am currently working on a game in JavaFX.</p>\n<p>I have to submit the game as a JAR file.</p>\n<p>I have made sure I have a main class that does not extend Application</p>\n<p>I tried to create the JAR file using the IntelliJ artifact method and the shade plugin method. Both of the method created a JAR file, but none of them were starting the JavaFX application when I double clicked the JAR file. The JAR file would only run from the terminal with the command <code>java -jar filepath.jar</code>.</p>\n<p>The application runs from the terminal, but gives the following warning</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>com.sun.javafx.application.PlatformImpl startup\nWARNING: Unsupported JavaFX configuration: classes were loaded from 'unnamed module @66ec91e5'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>How do I fix this. I want to be able to start the JavaFX application when I double click the jar file.</p>\n<p>I am using OpenJDK 22 and OpenJFX 22.</p>\n"
