    "body": "<p>In my Spring Boot app, I have some tests that look like this</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)\nclass InviteServiceTests {\n\n    @Mock\n    private UserService userService;\n\n    @Mock\n    private EmailSendingService emailSendingService;\n\n    @InjectMocks\n    private InviteService inviteService;\n\n    @Test\n    void testSomething() {\n        inviteService.inviteUser(&quot;user@example.com&quot;);\n        verify(emailSendingService).sendEmail(&quot;user@example.com&quot;);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I have to declare <code>userService</code> because it's a dependency of <code>inviteService</code> that is called during <code>inviteService.inviteUser</code>. However I don't need to mock or verify any <code>userService</code> methods, so IntelliJ marks this as an unused field.</p>\n<p>I'm aware I could tell IntelliJ to ignore any used fields annotated with <code>@Mock</code>, but what I'd prefer is to not have to declare this field at all. In other words, when a dependency of <code>InviteService</code> is found that does not have a corresponding <code>@Mock</code> field, Mockito will automatically create a default mock for the dependency.</p>\n<p>Currently, if the <code>userService</code> field is removed, the dependency is set to null, which causes a <code>NullPointerException</code> when the test runs.</p>\n"
