    "title": "How to correctly expose app-specific exit codes in jPackage-packaged application?",
    "body": "<p>I have a command-line Java application that uses app-specific exit codes [<code>System.exit(int)</code>], and is packaged with jPackage. The exit codes, as well as precise output to stdout and stderr, are important and meaningful for callers of the application.</p>\n<p>On one Windows machine, everything works as expected; the packaged .exe returns exit codes as expected (as reflected by %errorlevel%) when one of the non-zero exit codes is encountered. But on other Windows machines, the jPacakge executable is actually logging a (unwanted) message, <code>Child process exited with code...</code> and the actual process exit code is just 1 (no matter what actual exit code was used in <code>System.exit()</code>.</p>\n<p>I found this <a href=\"https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8284067\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">related OpenJDK bug</a> about it, but it was supposedly fixed for version 19 and <a href=\"https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8290948\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">back-ported to 17.0.5</a> . We used OpenJDK 17.0.9 which came after the fix and back-port.</p>\n<p>Why does only 1 machine do the correct thing, while 2 others still include the &quot;Child process exited...&quot; message?</p>\n<p>Is there any way to avoid this to allow the Java exit codes to bubble up to callers of the .exe?</p>\n"
