    "title": "Injecting a (user) context without Web/HttpContext",
    "body": "<p>I have the following problem:</p>\n<p>My environment is a typical Spring Boot application. I have Service-classes with business logic, which are using some metainformation, like &quot;locales&quot;, &quot;userId&quot;, &quot;userId&quot; and active modules or features.\nI used them by defining an own (Request-Scoped) Context-Object, which can be injected/autowired.</p>\n<p>But now I have additional entry points, which does not come from an HTTP-Servlet-Request but from other technology like event based streams.\nDo you know, if there is a similar solution in parallel to a WebContext? I'm looking for a way to define such metadata in any Context, which can be injected by my Service classes without handover it into the deepest part of the code.\nUsing Singletons seems not right, because each method-call/event can have an own Conext. So I'm looking for something like a &quot;EventMessage&quot;-Scope, similar to Request-Scope for HTTP-Request.</p>\n<p>Hopefully you understand what I mean.</p>\n"
