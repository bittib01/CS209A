    "title": "How to reduce heap space utilization when working with a list PDF documents?",
    "body": "<p>I have a microservice that generates multiple PDF Documents and saves to database. For generating each document, from the main service class, I call multiple document specific service class methods by passing an arraylist of Documents as argument.\nEach service class may or may not generate a pdf depending on the conditions and add it to the  arraylist. Finally I save the list of documents to the database.</p>\n<p>Can I reduce the heap space utilization by having each of the document service classes return a new document list and add them to a main list in main service class instead of passing the main list to each service class?</p>\n"
