    "title": "Does Spring Cloud Kubernetes Config support local spring config while allowing overrides from ConfigMaps",
    "body": "<p>Edited:</p>\n<p>I'm comparing Spring Cloud Config with Spring Cloud Kubernetes PropertySource of ConfigMaps. I've managed to do a quick POC with Spring Cloud Config, but I have not done a POC for the Spring Cloud Kubernetes. Both provide the ability to externalise your configuration.</p>\n<p>Spring Cloud Config allows you to source your config in a mixed fashion, allowing Spring Cloud Config AND <em>local spring config</em> (and by that I mean regular spring config sourced off the classpath in files on local disk).</p>\n<p>What is not 100% clear when reading the documentation of Spring Cloud Kubernetes PropertySource is whether it also supports the same ability to still source some config from <em>local spring config</em>. The documentation does not say either way; but reading all of <a href=\"https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-kubernetes/docs/current/reference/html/#kubernetes-propertysource-implementations\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chapter 5</a> - it leads me to think you can't use local config; and the bootstrap process fully hands over sourcing all config from config maps.</p>\n<p>It is also unclear how you would dev locally and easily make use of the config encoded in config maps.</p>\n<p>Questions about using spring-cloud-kubernetes config maps as a property source:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Does anyone have experience with this that could clarify if local config is supported?</li>\n<li>How you conveniently consume the same config when developing locally?</li>\n</ol>\n"
