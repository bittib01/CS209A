    "title": "How to Implement a Multi-Level ExpandableListView with Hierarchy: Plant → Department &amp; Section → Line → Devices in Android",
    "body": "<p>I am working on an Android project where I need to implement a hierarchical structure using an ExpandableListView. Currently, I have implemented a two-level hierarchy: Plant → Devices. Now, I want to expand this hierarchy to include additional levels as follows:&quot;\nPlant → Department-Section → Line → Devices</p>\n<p>I want to extend my current hierarchy to support four levels: Plant → Department-Section → Line → Devices. Here's how the hierarchy should look</p>\n<pre><code>Plant1\n   └── Department1-Section1\n       ├── Line1\n       │   ├── Device1\n       │   └── Device2\n       └── Line2\n           ├── Device3\n           └── Device4\n   └── Department2-Section2\n       ├── Line3\n           ├── Device5\n           └── Device6\n</code></pre>\n<p>I am not sure how to structure the data and create a custom adapter that can handle this four-level hierarchy. Since ExpandableListView natively supports only two levels (Group and Child),</p>\n<p>I need guidance on how to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Design a data structure to represent this hierarchy.</li>\n<li>Implement a custom adapter to render this hierarchy in the ExpandableListView.</li>\n<li>Handle nested levels like Department-Section and Line within the same framework.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I have considered using multiple ExpandableListViews or embedding a RecyclerView inside the child view for additional levels, but I'm unsure about the best approach for performance and scalability. I have not yet been able to integrate the three additional levels (Department-Section, Line, and Device)</p>\n"
