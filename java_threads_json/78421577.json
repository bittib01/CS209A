    "title": "How to load values from a SOPS file into a Java Spring Boot application",
    "body": "<p>I have a Java 21 Spring Boot 3.2 application that needs to load a bunch of properties. In the application, several files use:</p>\n<pre><code>@Value(&quot;${some.value}&quot;)\nprivate String someValue;\n</code></pre>\n<p>I also have a SOPS file containing several key/values that I need the Spring Boot app to be able to load. The file contents are in the following format:</p>\n<pre><code>some.value = myValue\n</code></pre>\n<p>How do I get the values loaded into the Spring Boot app?</p>\n<p>This is for local development. Right now the values are being copied into an application-local.properties file for local development. But then that file needs to be deleted after because having the two files is pointless and the SOPS file is encrypted. Is there a way to just load the values into the environment?</p>\n<p>Thanks.</p>\n"
