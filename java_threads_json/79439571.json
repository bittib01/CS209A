    "title": "Spurious warning about incompatible .class files version in vscode-java",
    "body": "<p>I often get a warning with vscode-java that I believe is incorrect: “Incompatible .class files version in required binaries. Project … is targeting a 17 runtime, but is compiled against '….jar' (from the container 'Maven Dependencies') which requires a 21 runtime”. I have inspected the JAR and it is supposed to be compatible with a 17 runtime. And indeed my project runs like a charm even though I only have Java 17 installed.</p>\n<p>I have filed <a href=\"https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-java/issues/3699\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">an issue</a> to vscode-java but it attracted no attention so far. Hence, I suspect that I may be doing something wrong, or perhaps have some configuration peculiarity that raises this problem on my machine but not on others.</p>\n<p>Is there any workaround for avoiding this warning? Or am I actually using a wrong JAR version?</p>\n<p>Opening <a href=\"https://github.com/oliviercailloux-org/Simple/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this project</a> in vscode with java pack and a Java 17 JRE should reproduce the problem, if the Eclipse include compiler settings modify the severity related to option id <a href=\"https://help.eclipse.org/latest/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.jdt.doc.isv%2Freference%2Fapi%2Forg%2Feclipse%2Fjdt%2Fcore%2FJavaCore.html&amp;anchor=CORE_INCOMPATIBLE_JDK_LEVEL\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>org.eclipse.jdt.core.incompatibleJDKLevel</code></a>.</p>\n"
