    "title": "How can I speed up my Android Bluetooth reception?",
    "body": "<h1>Hardware</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>The Bluetooth device is powered by a chip called <code>atmega32</code> and uses a <code>bm78</code> Bluetooth chip.</li>\n<li>The clock frequency of the MCU chip is <code>14.7456 MHz</code>.</li>\n<li>The baud rate of Bluetooth device is <code>115200</code>.</li>\n<li>The Bluetooth device transmits data in <code>BR/EDR mode</code>.</li>\n<li>The Bluetooth device sends 8 signals sampled at <code>250Hz</code> in a packet.</li>\n<li>The packet format is the <code>Cyton of OpenBCI</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Software</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>My app use <code>Rfcomm</code> to connect Bluetooth and receive data.</li>\n<li>Importing data from the thread through <code>bluetoothSocket.getInputStream()</code>, the priority of the thread is <code>Thread.MAX_PRIORITY(10)</code>. And the priority of the process in which that thread operates is <code>Process.THREAD_PRIORITY_URGENT_AUDIO</code>.</li>\n<li>My app draws a graph by obtaining an interval for each data reception.</li>\n<li>Since the signal is sampled at 250Hz, the average of the packet interval should be similar to <code>4ms</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Problem</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>But the average of the packet interval is <code>8ms</code>.</li>\n<li>How can I speed up my Android Bluetooth reception?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What I want to know is how to increase the Bluetooth data reception speed in an Android app using Java. The data needs to be received every 4ms through the InputStream, but currently, my app is reading the data every 8ms. Considering that I cannot modify the BM78 module, how can I improve the reception speed in my Android app?</p>\n"
