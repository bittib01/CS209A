    "title": "Is it possible to override a Point2D object from a superclass to a Point2D.Float?",
    "body": "<p>I have defined a class called <code>Entity</code> with a <code>Point2D</code> object in it called <code>pos</code>. The class is a superclass and it's not specified if <code>pos</code> should be a <code>Point2D.Float</code> or a <code>Point2D.Double</code>, that's left for the inheritors to decide. The problem is I don't know how to override this object to make it a <code>Point2D.Float</code> (for example) without getting an error.</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>import java.awt.geom.Point2D;\n\npublic class Entity {\n    Point2D pos;\n\n    public Entity(Point2D pos) {\n        this.pos = pos;\n        //...\n    }\n    //...\n}\n</code></pre>\n<hr />\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>import java.awt.geom.Point2D;\n\npublic class Enemy extends Entity {\n    // Somehow overrite &quot;pos&quot; so it must be Point2D.Float within this subclass\n    public Enemy(Point2D.Float pos) {\n        this.pos = pos;\n        //...\n    }\n    //...\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I tried to simply insert the <code>@Override</code> annotation before declaring <code>Point2D.Float pos;</code>, but the virtual environment I was working on indicated that that was an illegal use of <code>@Override</code>.\nI wasn't sure what I was supposed to do and I didn't find any answers on Stack Overflow.</p>\n<p>Thank you in advance.</p>\n<p>Edit: Made <code>Enemy</code> extend <code>Entity</code>, sorry for the confusion.</p>\n"
