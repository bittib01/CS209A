    "title": "How to duplicate a class with Spoon?",
    "body": "<p>My requirement is as such: I have a class (<code>a.b.C1</code>) contained in 3rd party library which I want to duplicate so I can make modifications and result into <code>x.y.C2</code>. In a few words, I need to make <code>x.y.C2</code> inherits <code>a.b.C1</code> and strip down few methods, and change visibilities.</p>\n<p>As I stumbled on lot of &quot;issues&quot; <em>(certainly due to my lack of knowleges on this topic)</em>. What I do is: create class <code>x.y.C2</code> and copy one by one fields/methods/nested types. The problem doing that, is when I copy a method having statements containing a nested type, the statement will contain references to the nested type I'm copying the nested from (<code>a.b.C1.N</code>) instead of (<code>x.y.C1.N</code>)</p>\n<p>First, is there a way to make this more straightforward? Ideally, I'd like to duplicate the class into new package (<code>x.y</code>) and make sure nested types will references this new class</p>\n"
