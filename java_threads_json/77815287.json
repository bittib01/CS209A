    "title": "How to handle Pageable on Controller layout with Spring Boot",
    "body": "<p>We have a Pageable object that is related to data layout, and it should be used in that context. How can we manage pagination in the controller layout without using the Pageable object? Perhaps there is a similar object for the controller layout</p>\n<p>I've attempted to implement it this way,</p>\n<p><code>@RequestParam(required = false, defaultValue = &quot;0&quot;) Integer page, @RequestParam(required = false, defaultValue = &quot;20&quot;) Integer size, @RequestParam(required = false) String... sort</code></p>\n<p>but encountered issues with sorting. It doesn't parse as a pair of values necessary for Spring, for example, it needs to be in the form of 'id,ASC,' but it parses as two separate items</p>\n"
