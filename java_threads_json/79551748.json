    "title": "Set RTL in one Layout but not in others in the same app?",
    "body": "<p><code>AppCompatDelegate.setApplicationLocales(LocaleListCompat.create(Locale.forLanguageTag(sLang)));</code> is nice to set RTL layouts in apps, works fine.</p>\n<p>But I have an Android app with a TabLayout with pagers and an extended BaseAdapter with text data tables made of text cells (writing them line by line). Same base adapter used for all tab pages but with different data.</p>\n<p>The different BaseAdapter can even be with the same data with different filter settings (showing the same data more or less).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It would be interesting if the base adapter could have different locales (LTR or RTL) for each tab page?  Same page in English and Urdu text and layout as two different tab-pages for example?</li>\n<li><code>AppCompatDelegate.setApplicationLocales()</code> changes the whole app?</li>\n<li><strong>Any good suggestion if it is possible?</strong></li>\n<li>I guess I'm not the only one asking for that, like in translation text apps, I guess it's needed?</li>\n</ul>\n"
