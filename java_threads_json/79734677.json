    "title": "Gradle Publishing in Github Workflows doesn&#39;t work (403 Forbidden)",
    "body": "<p>I'm running into a really weird issue.</p>\n<p>I'm unable to make my Github Workflow work, which is supposed to upload artifacts of mine on my self-hosted repository but it always fails when it tries to upload the jar.sha1 artifact with 403, but the .jar artifact is fully uploaded.</p>\n<p>Trying on my own machine with the gradle task and the same users and credentials as the github workflow and it uploads all the artifacts without any issues.</p>\n<p>Even weirder when checking the logs of Nexus and Nginx my server never receives the second request to upload the .jar.sha1 artifact.. I can see the .jar artifact being uploaded and returning 201 as a result.</p>\n<p>So I'm absolutely sure that it isn't misconfigured permissions or a faulty workflow file.</p>\n<p>If anyone has an idea of what's happening I would be glad to know!</p>\n<p>Here is my project on github, it's based of another repo I'm working on it's simply to freely test and break stuff before moving it into my main project.
