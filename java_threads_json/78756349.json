    "title": "VS Powershell wont let me compile, but using it externally will",
    "body": "<p>I'm currently using two different languages and having a similar issue on both. With Java the powershell within VS code isn't allowing me to compile using Javac, and I can't use GHCI for Haskell.</p>\n<p>However, when i use the 'normal' powershell it is completely fine. Does anyone have any ideas why?</p>\n<p>I get this error when i try to use these commands:</p>\n<p>&quot;ghci : The term 'ghci' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program. Check the\nspelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.\nAt line:1 char:1</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ghci</li>\n<li>\n<pre><code>  + CategoryInfo          : ObjectNotFound: (ghci:String) [], CommandNotFoundException\n  + FullyQualifiedErrorId : CommandNotFoundException&quot;\n\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I get an identical one for Javac (minus the GHCI bit)</p>\n"
