    "title": "Some labels are not properly displayed when in Full HD with 125% scaling",
    "body": "<p>We are currently migrate from Java 8 to Java 11. Now I test how our application works with scaling. The problem I've faced is that some labels (mostly used as a table renderer) are horizontally cut by a pixel when the window is on Full HD screen with 125% scaling. I have another screen with 4k resolution and 250% scaling, but can't reproduce my problem when application window is on this screen. The same is when I turn off scaling on my Full HD screen (get no problem).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/LteFk1dr.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/LteFk1dr.png\" alt=\"Scaling problem\" /></a></p>\n<p>As you see the last digit in the plain &quot;136,00&quot; is cut by 1 pixel. It seems, that computing of String width works wrong in my case.</p>\n<p>In my application the Roboto font is used. When I change the font to Arial I get same problems but on another places.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately I can't reproduce this problem in a minimal reproduceable example (MRE). But maybe somebody has faced same problems and know how to overcome them.</p>\n<p>My OS is Windows 10.</p>\n"
