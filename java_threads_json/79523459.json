    "title": "What&#39;s wrong with Camunda 8 Run?",
    "body": "<p>I'm installing Camunda 8 Run to be able to run processes in BPMN. I have already installed the Modeler. I extract the file and open the terminal in the corresponding folder in order to run the command <code>.\\c8run start</code> to run it. The run doesn't start, and this comes out:</p>\n<pre><code>Java version is C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk-21\nYou must use at least JDK 21 to start Camunda Platform Run.\n</code></pre>\n<p>This seems like a clear nonsense to me. That is, it's telling me that I have Java 21, but to use Camunda I have to install Java 21. But that doesn't make any sense, I mean I can't see where the problem is. Yes, I have already checked all the environment variables, I only have one version of Java installed and there is no conflicting file. Can anyone help me with this? It's about my thesis</p>\n"
