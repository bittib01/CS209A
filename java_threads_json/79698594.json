    "title": "caching a serialized immutable object in Jackson",
    "body": "<h3>Use case</h3>\n<p>Say I have an HTTP endpoint that constructs an immutable object then sends that immutable object to multiple sinks.  Maybe I send it to a couple of message brokers, other HTTP endpoints, a file, whatever.</p>\n<p>On each send, let's say Jackson is being used to serialize the immutable object.</p>\n<h3>Questions</h3>\n<p>Am I right that I could get a significant performance benefit if Jackson could</p>\n<ol>\n<li>recognize (or be told) that the object was immutable and was going to serialized multiple times</li>\n<li>cache the result of the first serialization in a byte-sequence of some kind</li>\n<li>reuse that byte-sequence on subsequent calls to <code>write...</code></li>\n</ol>\n<p>If there would be a benefit, my second question is: does Jackson or any other popular serialization framework offer this optimization?</p>\n<h3>Thoughts</h3>\n<p>If that is a benefit to performance, it would really be nice if the serialization framework offered it.  While I <strong>could</strong> write my own wrapper and memoize the result, I would then lose the type-safety of the calls to the sending functions.</p>\n<p>I guess it would still be tricky because each of the sending functions would need to be using the same ObjectMapper (or the same cache, at least).</p>\n"
