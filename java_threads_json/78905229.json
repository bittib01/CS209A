    "body": "<p>I am creating an OAuth2 authorization server using Spring Authorization Server.</p>\n<p>For generating JWT, I have configured the RSAKey. I have set the certificate's SHA-1 thumprint using RSAKey.Builder.x509CertThumbprint method. However, once I generate the token, the x5t header is not included.</p>\n<p>If I set the SHA-256 thumbprint, then that is added in the generated JWT's header.</p>\n<p>Also, the method RSAKey.Builder.x509CertThumbprint is marked deprecated. But I need to have the x5t header added. Is there any way I can add it?</p>\n"
