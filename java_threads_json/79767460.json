    "title": "Java Beans are not being created when not referenced by others directly in Weld",
    "body": "<p>I have 2 providers which contains details about themselves and they are updating a ProviderDetails class which contains details of all the providers</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>class ProviderA{ \n    @Inject \n    AllProviderDetails allProviderDetails;\n\n    @postConstruct\n    void init(){\n    allProviderDetails.update(something);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>class ProviderB{ \n    @Inject \n    AllProviderDetails allProviderDetails;\n    \n    @postConstruct\n    void init(){\n    allProviderDetails.update(something);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>@Singleton \nclass AllProviderDetails { \n    public void getDetails(){\n    return something; \n    }\n\n    public void update(){\n    update details\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The application injects just the AllProviderDetails which should contain details of all the providers</p>\n<pre><code>class Main{ \n@Inject AllProviderDetails;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The problem is that PostContruct methods are not being called on ProviderA and ProviderB by Weld(meaning the beans are not being created) and the application doesn't have have details of any providers.</p>\n<p>Shouldn't the ProviderA and ProviderB be created and managed by Weld. Is there any annotation which forces them to be created even if they have no references? On Injecting the ProviderA and ProviderB in the application elsewhere the beans are being created(cause I am assuming they have a refernce now).</p>\n<p>Also on checking the behaviour with Spring, it automatically creates Beans if they have @Component annotations, is there something similar in Weld to do the same.</p>\n<p>Weld version 3.1.9</p>\n"
