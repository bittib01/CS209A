    "title": "most efficient way to add &quot;host&quot; with current hostname of an instance, in clusterred environment",
    "body": "<p>I'm trying to add a Global Variable named host that dynamically reflects the current instance where the application is running.</p>\n<p>I'm working with TIBCO BW 5 applications, which are configured via .xml files on the front end, and run as pure Java code on the backend.</p>\n<p>What I've tried so far:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Manual injection into Application.xml: This works, but only when I manually set the value per instance. Without a proper script to inject the correct value on Instance A and another for Instance B, deployment in a clustered environment doesn't behave as expected—it ends up using the hardcoded value.</li>\n<li>Modifying bwengine.tra and designer.tra: I attempted this based on suggestions from various LLMs, but unfortunately, it had no effect.</li>\n<li>Using a shared .projlib or manipulating the .jar: I explored both options, but neither yielded a successful outcome.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note: I'm specifically looking for a solution that does not involve using the Administrator GUI.</p>\n<p>Has anyone encountered this issue before or found a reliable workaround?</p>\n"
