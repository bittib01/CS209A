    "title": "Getting error when running appium in a iOS device",
    "body": "<p>I am trying to run Appium on my ios device. I was able to install webdriveragent on my device and the build is ok but when I try to test the connectivity from my java app I am getting below error.</p>\n<pre><code>Could not start a new session. Response code 500. Message: An unknown server-side error occurred while processing the command. Original error: Unable to launch WebDriverAgent because of xcodebuild failure: xcodebuild failed with code 65. \nThis usually indicates an issue with the local Xcode setup or WebDriverAgent project configuration or the driver-to-platform version mismatch. \nConsider setting 'showXcodeLog' capability to true in order to check the Appium server log for build-related error messages.. Make sure you follow the tutorial at https://github.com/appium/appium-xcuitest-driver/blob/master/docs/real-device-config.md. Try to remove the WebDriverAgentRunner application from the device if it is installed and reboot the device.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here is my Java code to test the connectivity</p>\n<pre><code>    DesiredCapabilities capabilities = new DesiredCapabilities();\n    capabilities.setCapability(&quot;platformName&quot;, &quot;iOS&quot;);\n    capabilities.setCapability(&quot;platformVersion&quot;, &quot;16.6.1&quot;);\n    capabilities.setCapability(&quot;deviceName&quot;, &quot;&quot;);    \n\n    capabilities.setCapability(&quot;udid&quot;, &quot;00008030-000000000&quot;);\n    capabilities.setCapability(&quot;xcodeSigningId&quot;, &quot;iPhone Developer&quot;);\n    capabilities.setCapability(&quot;automationName&quot;, &quot;xcuitest&quot;);\n    \n    \n     driver = new IOSDriver(new URL(&quot;http://0.0.0.0:4723&quot;), capabilities);\n</code></pre>\n"
