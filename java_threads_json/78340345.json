    "title": "Generate a type from a Java DTO type with many fields being null and have all getters as Optional&lt;T&gt;",
    "body": "<p>I am currently working with a Java DTO class (written by others) that has almost 300 fields where many of these end up being null. What I see in the codebase are lots of null checks and more recently I have been using <code>Optional.ofNullable</code> to work around this (given I come from a functional background) and find that easier to work with.</p>\n<p>However, I would like to avoid having to remember to do that everywhere I need to access one of those fields and possibly return a different kind of object where the return type is always of <code>Optional&lt;T&gt;</code>.</p>\n<p>There is a similar post <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72550789/generate-a-type-from-another-type-and-change-fields-to-optional\"><strong>here</strong></a> about the problem in Python but I would be interested in what can also be done in Java. I can of course just live with it or generate a separate class with optional getters myself but was interested if anyone has any smarter approaches or good design patterns to use for such cases.</p>\n<p>In my case when a field is null the most common scenario is not to throw a exception but to use some fallback mechanism or default value which is why the Optional class works nicely.</p>\n"
