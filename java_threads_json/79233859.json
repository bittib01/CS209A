    "title": "Eclipse Scout Property Change Event from Javascript to Java",
    "body": "<p>I wanted to ask how a JavaScript execute a PropertyChangeEvent for Java.</p>\n<p>I am trying to fill a StringField in Javascript. However, since it is readonly by the property (enabled = false), set in Java-Client, the value is set in the field, but neither the value nor a change are triggered in the Java area of my Eclipse Scout project. If it is not readonly, I can use it without any problems and carry out further steps in the Java area, or even react to it at all.</p>\n<p>So I thought I could use a change event to trigger it manually. But that doesn't seem to work either. Neither trigger(), onchange, addEventListener(), on(), nor change() seem to work.</p>\n<p>I load the input field for the StringField like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-js prettyprint-override\"><code>let myValue = &quot;MyContent&quot;;\n/* get inputfield */\nlet myField= $(`div[data-modelclass~=&quot;my.project.path.MyForm$MyRootGroupBox$MyStringField&quot;] input`);\n/* set value */\nmyField.focus().val(myValue).blur().click();\n</code></pre>\n<p>I have to admit that I don't have a lot of experience in events, but if I use different examples from the internet, one of them should actually work. Does anyone have any idea how to do this, or at least know that it really can't work?</p>\n"
