    "title": "JAVA SpringBoot Entity data recursion",
    "body": "<p>So I have two entities, Recipe and User. In recipes we have the User object. User object has a list with all the Recipes that he has written.</p>\n<p>Recipe Entity:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>@Entity\n@Table(name = &quot;recipes&quot;)\npublic class Recipe {\n    @Id\n    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)\n    private long id;\n\n    @ManyToOne\n    @JoinColumn(name = &quot;user_id&quot;)\n    private User user;\n</code></pre>\n<p>User Entity:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>@Entity\n@Table(name = &quot;users&quot;)\npublic class User {\n    @Id\n    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)\n    private int id;\n\n    @OneToMany(mappedBy = &quot;user&quot;)\n    private List&lt;Recipe&gt; recipesWritten;\n</code></pre>\n<p>When I get the entity Recipe, it returns a User object, which has a list with all the Recipe objects that the user created and it goes on recursively.</p>\n<p>I've seen the fix with <code>@JsonManagedReference</code> which somehow fixes the issue but while debugging I noticed that the object still has recursion and I would like the JSON to include some stuff (without recursion).</p>\n<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated</p>\n"
