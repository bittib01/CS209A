    "title": "Why does Java Date always display in system time zone instead of UTC?",
    "body": "<p>I am working on a <strong>Java 8</strong> application where I receive epoch millisecond timestamps that represent UTC time. I need to pass these timestamps as <code>Date</code> objects to <strong>a method that I do not control</strong> (from a third-party library). That method eventually outputs the date but the <strong>string representation always reflects the system’s time zone (UTC-3)</strong>, <strong>even though the timestamp was in UTC</strong>.</p>\n<p>I cannot see or modify the implementation of that method. What I only know is: it ends up showing the wrong clock time (UTC-3) instead of the expected UTC time.</p>\n<p>Is there any way to ensure that a Date object, when displayed by a system that I do not control, will be shown in UTC? Without changing the system default time zone?</p>\n<h2>Debugging details</h2>\n<p><strong>Desired behviour:</strong> I want <code>Date.toString()</code> to return the UTC time, for example <code>Sun Jun 15 15:06:40 UTC 2025</code>.</p>\n<p><strong>Specific problem:</strong> <code>Date.toString()</code> returns time in the default time zone of the JVM, for example <code>Sun Jun 15 12:06:40 GMT-03:00 2025</code>.</p>\n<p><strong>Shortest code to reproduce:</strong></p>\n<pre><code>System.out.println(new Date(1_750_000_000_000L));\n</code></pre>\n"
