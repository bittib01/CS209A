    "body": "<p>I have finished my app using expo SDK 52 and made a local and EAS development build of it which is both succesful at building the artifact, and i can install it on my emulator using Android studio.</p>\n<p>When launching the app however i am greeted with the following error and no further stacktrace or logs. I do not have any non top level import statements in my code and my app also runs fine in Expo Go. I havent changed the metro or babel configs either. What could be causing this problem to occur only with dev builds?</p>\n<p>Sorry for the limited information but i dont have more either and dont know where the problem can be. Happy to provide more info/code if requested.</p>\n<pre><code>There was a problem loading the project\nThe development build encountered the following error\nCompiling JS failed: 1208:3 import declaration must be at top level of module\nrun\nNativeRunnable.Java\nhandleCallback\nHandler.Java\ndispatchMessage\nHandler.Java\ndispatchMessage\nMessageQueueThreadHandler.Java\nloopOnce\nLooper.java\nloop\nLooper.java\nlambda$startNewBackgroundThread$2\nMessageQueueThreadImpl.java\nrun\nDB$$SyntheticClass\nrun\nThread.java\n</code></pre>\n"
