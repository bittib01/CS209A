    "title": "Proton-J2 AMQP 1.0 Receiver that filters messages?",
    "body": "<p>I'm investigating writing a systems integration using AMQP and looking to copy some common system integration patterns used with JMS based APIs. That includes a message-consumer that filters messages from an incoming queue based on some expression.</p>\n<p>I see that RabbitMQ implements server-side message filtering using AMQP 1.0 Filter Expressions as of version 4.1 and the SwiftMQ Java API seems to allow filtering on the Consumer, however the Proton-J2 API seems a lot more modern than the SwiftMQ API so I'd prefer to use that over SwiftMQ.</p>\n<p>But I cannot find a way yet to filter messages on a Receiver in Proton-J2?</p>\n<p>Is there such a feature that I haven't found yet, or is such a feature in the works?</p>\n<p>What would it take to add such a feature to the library?</p>\n"
