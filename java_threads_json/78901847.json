    "body": "<p>I am working on a JHipster project that uses Spring Boot for the backend and Angular for the frontend. I want to run the backend and frontend separately on different ports to facilitate development and debugging.</p>\n<p>Here's what I've tried so far:</p>\n<p>For the backend: I use ./mvnw to start the Spring Boot application on port 8080, and it works as expected.\nFor the frontend: I use npm start to start the Angular development server on port 4200. However, when I open the frontend in the browser, I get a blank page.\nHow can I resolve the blank page issue when running the Angular frontend separately?\nBackend: Spring Boot 2.0.5.RELEASE\nFrontend: Angular 12\nJHipster: Version 5.4.1</p>\n"
