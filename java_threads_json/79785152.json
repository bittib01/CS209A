    "body": "<p>I am using Eclipse 2025-09. When attaching the remote debugger to Module B, my entire JBoss server gets suspended, even though I have set all breakpoint settings to suspend only the thread.</p>\n<p>I work on multiple modules, where Module A calls Module B. When I attach the debugger to Module B, all JBoss threads get suspended, including those running Module A’s code.</p>\n<p>I have tried all the debugger settings available on Google but couldn’t find anything beyond the breakpoint property to suspend only the thread. Although I tried that option, it did not change the situation.</p>\n"
