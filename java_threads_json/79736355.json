    "body": "<p>Why does OpenAPI Generator generate some of the methods with <code>_&lt;Number&gt;</code>, even though operation IDs in my spec are unique?\nIs there any workaround (by using properties) in OpenAPI 7.9.0? There is <a href=\"https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/issues/19865\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">an issue</a> opened for that, but I am not sure if it was fixed and in which version it was fixed. Does it mean I should bump to another version?</p>\n"
