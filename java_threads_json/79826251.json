    "title": "Bruce Eckel : Constructor is a static method",
    "body": "<p>Reading through the masterpiece <strong>Thinking in Java, Bruce Eckel</strong> in many location mentioned that the constructor is a static method. I can't find any article or reference supporting this idea, even I asked different AI,  all assured this idea is wrong.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Here is one quote from the book chapter &quot;Type Information&quot; page 395</em><br />\nAll classes are loaded into the JVM dynamically, upon the first use of a class. This happens when the program makes the first reference to a static member of that class. <strong>It turns out that the constructor is also a static method of a class, even though the static keyword is not used for a constructor</strong>. Therefore, creating a new object of that class using the new operator also counts as a reference to a static member of the class.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are different location in the book where the author mentioned it clearly, Constructor is a static method.</p>\n<p><strong>Is Constructor a static method ?</strong></p>\n"
