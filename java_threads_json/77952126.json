    "title": "Question about comparing Java&#39;s HashMap `find` method and `tieBreakOrder`",
    "body": "<p>I've been studying Java's HashMap and a few questions have come up.\nLooking at the <code>find</code> method of <code>HashMap</code>, it is written as follows:</p>\n<pre><code>else if ((q = pr.find(h, k, kc)) != null)\n    return q;\nelse\n    p = pl;\n</code></pre>\n<p>In contrast, other methods in <code>HashMap</code> such as <code>putTreeVal</code> or <code>treeify</code> use the <code>tieBreakOrder</code> method. I'm curious about the difference between these two.</p>\n<pre><code>static int tieBreakOrder(Object a, Object b) {\n    int d;\n    if (a == null || b == null ||\n        (d = a.getClass().getName().\n         compareTo(b.getClass().getName())) == 0)\n        d = (System.identityHashCode(a) &lt;= System.identityHashCode(b) ?\n             -1 : 1);\n    return d;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>As I see it, both have commonality in traversing tree nodes - the <code>find</code> method directly traverses the nodes of the tree while <code>tieBreakOrder</code> seems to be comparing several values.</p>\n<p>So, I thought about it from the perspective of atomic operations. I assumed that visiting a single node and comparing primitive data values take about the same operation time. As a result, I concluded that the <code>find</code> method – which actually traverses nodes – might be faster than <code>tieBreakOrder</code>, which compares many primitive values.</p>\n<p>However, I'm not sure if my assumption is correct, or if there is any other reason that I can understand more about the difference between the <code>find</code> and <code>tieBreakOrder</code> methods?</p>\n"
