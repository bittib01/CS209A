    "body": "<p>I'm facing an issue with GridDB and seeking clarification on how to handle it effectively.</p>\n<p>Error Message: TXN_REPLICATION_LOG_LSN_INVALID</p>\n<p>Description: Execution of replication failed.</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>    ReplicationInfo replInfo = new ReplicationInfo();\n    replInfo.setMode(ReplicationMode.NORMAL);\n    replInfo.setNotificationAddress(notificationAddress);\n    replInfo.setNotificationPort(notificationPort);\n    gridStore.setReplicationInfo(replInfo);\n\n  // Perform data operations\n  // (e.g., put, get, etc.)\n\n    gridStore.disconnect();\n</code></pre>\n<p>The error explanation suggests that a failure may have occurred within the cluster, leading to the replication failure.</p>\n<p>According to the provided countermeasures, the cluster control section is expected to automatically detect the replication failure and perform recovery processing. Hence, no manual response is required.</p>\n<p>Despite understanding the automatic recovery process, I would like clarification on how the cluster control section detects and handles replication failures. Additionally, are there any specific configurations or settings I should check to ensure the smooth operation of replication in my GridDB cluster?</p>\n<p>Any insights or guidance on resolving this error would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your assistance!</p>\n"
