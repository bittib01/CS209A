    "body": "<p>In doFinally have printed the signal type to finally verify that it was a cancellation (CANCEL). However, this is not captured as part of doOnError as technically cancellation is not part of error.</p>\n<p>Root causes I can see why cancellation occurs is because</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Timeouts: If you use .timeout(), cancellation will occur if the timeout elapses.</li>\n<li>Manual disposal: If you call .dispose() or .cancel() on the subscription.</li>\n<li>Application shutdown: If the app or thread is stopped.</li>\n<li>Backpressure: If downstream cancels due to resource limits.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>However, unlike <code>doOnError(Throwable t -&gt; {})</code> - <code>doOnCancel(()-&gt;{})</code> does not provide the stacktrace to find the root cause of which operation caused this cancel.</p>\n<p>This is a complex code where multiple library methods are invoked so its not so direct to trace it via the code. The cancellation is happening only in our production environment and in no other environments. Our primary suspect is the resource and memory limits.</p>\n<p>But is there a way to trace the root cause of the cancel signal - like which method or operation caused this?</p>\n<p>I'm not sure if using <code>Hooks.onOperatorDebug()</code> would be wise.</p>\n"
