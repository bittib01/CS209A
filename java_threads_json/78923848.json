    "body": "<p>I am working on upgrading a JAVA application.\nI am working with <code>Gradle 8.5</code>, and upgrading to <code>JAVA 17</code> and <code>Spring Boot 3.2.5</code></p>\n<p>While working on the upgrades, I ran into an issue involving <code>com.fasterxml.jackson.*</code> libraries.</p>\n<p>Prior, troubleshooting, the only jackson library I had was:\n<code>org.openapitools:jackson-databind-nullable:0.2.4</code></p>\n<p>The error message I received stated:</p>\n<p><code>NoSuchMethodError: void com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat.yaml.YAMLParser.createChildObject(int, int)</code></p>\n<p>I did some rather extensive research and tried a fair number of possible resolutions.</p>\n<p>The first thing I tried was adding in the <code>com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat-yaml</code> library. I initially attempted with version <code>2.13.0</code>, but this didn't seem to resolve the issue.</p>\n<p>I ran <code>./gradlew dependencyInsight -dependency jackson</code> to see what version(s) it might be calling in. I found it bouncing between version <code>2.12.x</code> and <code>2.15.4</code>. Notating this, I attempted to force version <code>2.15.4</code> by adjusting the package versions that were bouncing around until all were calling version <code>2.14.x</code> or <code>2.15.4</code> and setting the dependency implementation to specifically call version <code>2.15.4</code>.</p>\n<p>This didn't resolve the issue either. So I then tried updating the packages to versions using <code>2.15.4</code> or later... Which also didn't work.</p>\n<p>I then tried implementing all of the related jackson libraries and pointing them all to version <code>2.15.4</code> (<code>jackson-core</code>, <code>jackson-databind</code>, <code>jackson-dataformat-yaml</code>, <code>jackson-datatype-jdk8</code>, etc...). Unfortunately, that also didn't seem to make a difference.</p>\n<p>I tried following some of the suggestions found here:\n<a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70422060/object-mapper-yamlfactory-exception-due-to-missing-createcontentreference-m\">Object Mapper - YAMLFactory - exception due to missing _createContentReference method</a></p>\n<p>But this didn't seem to work either and added new problems in which other methods were now missing...</p>\n<p>I am kinda at a loss here and could really use some suggestions.</p>\n"
