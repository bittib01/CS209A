    "body": "<p>I have a hazelcast cluster in which there are two instances running in spring boot java project.\nI want to secure this cluster/instances so that no clients will connect to it to access data.</p>\n<p>I am using open source edition of hazelcast. How can I achieve this?\nOne approach is to use different clusternames but this solution doesn't suit my requirement.</p>\n<p>Is there any other authentication methods available in open source edition? Please help.</p>\n"
