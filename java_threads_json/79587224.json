    "title": "dwr-2024 package throws internal version error",
    "body": "<p>I have an older Java/JSP application that I have to update to Tomcat 10 by May 31, 2025.  This change in Tomcat versions covers Java's recent <code>javax -&gt; jakarta</code> API namespace change in the packages included with Tomcat, so I have to update the application to use the <code>jakarta</code> namespace instead of <code>javax</code>.</p>\n<p>This application imports a class <code>WebContextFactory</code> (<code>uk.ltd.getahead.dwr.WebContextFactory.class</code>) from a package called &quot;DWR&quot; (&quot;Direct Web Remoting&quot;) that's contained in a JAR <code>dwr.jar</code> that we don't have the source code for.  This class invokes the <code>javax</code> namespace, and thus I can't update my application without either amending the source code or (preferably) replacing it with a more up-to-date version of the package.</p>\n<p>There does appear to be an <a href=\"https://github.com/olddimplex/dwr-2024/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">updated version</a> of the library on GitHub.  However, when I attempt to build this source code into a JAR using the provided Ant buildfile, it results in an internal error due to its included <code>jakarta.servlet.ServletConfig</code> class:</p>\n<pre><code>    [javac] .../dwr-2024/core/api/main/java/org/directwebremoting/ServerContext.java:5: error: cannot access ServletConfig\n    [javac] import jakarta.servlet.ServletConfig;\n    [javac]                       ^\n    [javac]   bad class file: .../dwr-2024/target/ant/lib/jakarta.servlet-api-6.1.0.jar(jakarta/servlet/ServletConfig.class)\n    [javac]     class file has wrong version 55.0, should be 52.0\n    [javac]     Please remove or make sure it appears in the correct subdirectory of the classpath.\n</code></pre>\n<p>This file does not have source code within the <code>dwr-2024</code> code repo, so I can't investigate further based on what I have.</p>\n<p>The DWR project's GitHub page, linked above, doesn't allow issues to be posted.  They have a Dojo page for users, and I've <a href=\"https://discourse.dojo.io/t/jakarta-servletconfig-gives-wrong-version-error/654\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">posted there</a>, but it seems to be full-on dead at this point and I can't rely on getting help there in time to meet the May 31 deadline.</p>\n<p>I have independently found the <a href=\"https://github.com/jakartaee/servlet/blob/master/api/src/main/java/jakarta/servlet/ServletConfig.java\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">source code</a> for <code>jakarta.servlet.ServletConfig</code>, but I'm not certain I have the skill to amend it to work with <code>dwr-2024</code>.  Does anyone here a better way to either contact the DWR group for help, or another way to fix this code?</p>\n"
