    "body": "<p>I have entity Contract, which holds a list of Deals inside. I model them in the following way:</p>\n<pre><code>public class Contract {\n\n    @Id\n    private Long id;\n    @MappedCollection(idColumn = &quot;CONTRACT_TO_DEAL&quot;, keyColumn = &quot;CONTRACT_TO_DEAL_INDEX&quot;)\n    private List&lt;Deal&gt; deals= new ArrayList&lt;Deal&gt;();\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I can easily get my Contract with all linked Deals using Contract repository:</p>\n<pre><code>public interface ContractRepository extends ListCrudRepository&lt;Contract, Long&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>I know I can get sorted Deals using Deals repository via Sort, Paging, adding OrderBy etc.</p>\n<p>The question is:\nIs there a way to configure my setup in order to get Contract with Deals sorted using standard methods of Contract repository?\nI.e. if I get Contract by Id, I obtain Contract with Deals ordered?</p>\n<p>In other words, each time I need Contract, I need it with Deals sorted by creation date. I never need Contract with Deals sorted in other way, or unsorted.</p>\n"
