    "title": "Collection with fragmented index",
    "body": "<p>I want to map a DB-table into a Java collection object. Important for me is a numerical index IDX and some other data, e.g. a STR.</p>\n<pre><code>IDX        STR\n1          Max\n2          Sam\n4          Tom\n7          Hal\n8          Tim\n27         Sue\n30         Sal\n</code></pre>\n<p>The only operation I need to have on the collection is an order by IDX.</p>\n<p>e.g.</p>\n<pre><code>All above 20: Sue, Sal\nAll below 3: Sam, Max\n</code></pre>\n<p>First think I get in mind is to use a Map with Key is IDX and Value is STR.\nBut to get the order I would have to inspect every element.</p>\n<p>Using a List would need some search-method because no direct access (e.g. 3rd element is IDX 4 and not 3).</p>\n<p>Any better ideas on that?</p>\n"
