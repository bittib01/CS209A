    "title": "Is PDF signature appearance taken into account in the bytes that are signed in a iText PDF document signature?",
    "body": "<p>I am signing a PDF document with iText and I want to do it in two steps: first make a request to my java spring application to obtain the bytes to be signed, and then make another request to sign them.</p>\n<p>What I would like to know is whether the signature appearance is taken into account in those bytes or not, that is to say, if the signature appearance is added to the signature or if it is only an esthetical aspect. If it is not taken into account I will not prepare the signature appearance when requesting for the bytes to be signed so I don't do it twice.</p>\n"
