    "body": "<p>I was using Fabric Java chaincodes and CLI to work with the creation of assets by different chaincodes in the same channel, and it seems to me that only the chaincode that defined that particular asset can implement getStringState/putStringState  in its logic for that asset, so it works. Other chaincodes return nothing. it is network <a href=\"https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/main/test-network\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/main/test-network</a> that I am using.</p>\n<p>I am also interested how to put restrictions in networks where there is not this kind of restriction,</p>\n"
