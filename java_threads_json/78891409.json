    "body": "<p>I have this field for appointment time which is of type LocalDateTime. I want to format it so that it can only accept hour and minute instead of the whole year,month,day, hour,minute etc that it normally returns. I know that I can achieve that by passing a string and a time formatter but I just want to pass the pattern directly to it</p>\n<pre><code>    public class BookingDto {\n        private Long doctorId;\n        private Long patientId;\n        private LocalDate appointmentDate;\n    \n         //This is the attribute\n         // I need it in this format 08:23\n        private LocalDateTime appointmentTime;\n        private BigDecimal totalPrice;\n        private Status status;\n        private String note;\n    }\n</code></pre>\n"
