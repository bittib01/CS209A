    "title": "Do Java 21 virtual threads address the main reason to switch to reactive single-thread frameworks?",
    "body": "<p>To my understanding one of the reasons to switch to a reactive (e.g. <a href=\"https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/reference/#_blocking_can_be_wasteful\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Project Reactor</a>, RxJava, <a href=\"https://vertx.io/introduction-to-vertx-and-reactive/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Vert-X</a>) or actor (Akka) framework is because of the cost of thread switching is high.  Looking at <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78094984/difference-between-platform-thread-carrier-thread-and-virtual-thread-in-context\">Difference between platform thread, carrier thread and virtual thread in context of Java 21 and later</a> and other information about virtual threads I was wondering...</p>\n<p>Do Virtual Threads remove the reason to switch to a different paradigm because it will just swap out the blocking virtual thread to a different thread on the carrier?</p>\n"
