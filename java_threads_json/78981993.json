    "body": "<p>Despite configurations, I keep encountering the error: &quot;Unable to decrypt AES-256&quot; while trying to access the application.</p>\n<p>I've developed an internal Java 17 spring-boot application with SSO validation using Kerberos and SPNEGO. I have an SSO and Regular login page; if the SSO validations fail, user can log in using their credentials. Our setup includes the following:</p>\n<pre><code>AD: Azure AD\nKDC: Multiple (Local)\nApplication Host Server: Azure cloud\nApplication Server: Tomcat 10.1\n</code></pre>\n<p>I've created a unique user in AD with admin privileges and enabled AES encryption types (AES-256, AES-128, RC-HMAC) for both the user and the computer.</p>\n<p>I’ve also generated a keytab file with the same encryptions, configured Tomcat with the appropriate credentials, and set up the krb5.ini and jass.conf.ini files.</p>\n"
