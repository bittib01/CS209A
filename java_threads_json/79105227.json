    "body": "<p>I think I'm starting to understand this, but I was unable to find a satisfactory answer anywhere else and would love confirmation from someone with more java experience:</p>\n<p>When I go to <a href=\"https://java.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">java.com</a> to download the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), the latest version I can find there is Java 8, which was released 10 years ago and has already hit its &quot;End of Public Updates&quot; date.  There are 3 (soon to be 4) LTE releases that are newer than version 8, so why does java.com continue to recommend Java 8?  Where do I get the new LTE versions?</p>\n"
