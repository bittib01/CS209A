    "title": "How can I create a virtual camera in Android to overlay on top of the real phone camera or create a new virtual camera source?",
    "body": "<p>I'm working on an Android application where I want to capture the output of the real phone camera and overlay custom graphics on top of it. To achieve this, I need to create a virtual camera that will replace or overlay the output of the real camera. I'm unsure about the approach I should take to accomplish this.</p>\n<p>Here's what I've tried so far:</p>\n<p>I attempted to use the Android Camera API to capture the output of the real camera and draw graphics on top of it, but I couldn't get it to work as expected.\nI looked into the CameraX library, but couldn't find a direct method for creating a virtual camera.\nI'm a bit confused about what I should do next. Is there a way to create a virtual camera or manipulate the output of the real camera in Android? Any suggestions or guidance would be greatly appreciated.</p>\n<p>My goal is to create a virtual camera source that appears as an option in other camera apps, allowing users to select it and see the output of the virtual camera with overlays or replacements.</p>\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n"
