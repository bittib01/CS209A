    "title": "Netbeans Maven remote debugging - debug button defaults to local host address and fails to connect",
    "body": "<p>I have a Maven project which runs fine remotely using the Run button. Clicking the Debug button results in the program running remotely and listening for the debugger on the socket chosen by netbeans. However I see this out put at the start of the debug session</p>\n<pre><code>JPDA Listening Start...\nJPDA Address: 127.0.0.1:56821\nPort:56821\n</code></pre>\n<p>My program is running remotely</p>\n<pre><code>  [sshexec] Connecting to 192.168.1.168:22\n  [sshexec] cmd : java  -Xmx2G -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=192.168.1.168:56821 -cp java -cp /home/pi/NetBeansProjects/RPi_Drums-1.0/RPi_Drums-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar ca.qzic.drumpedals.DrumPedals.DrumPedal\nListening for transport dt_socket at address: 56821\n</code></pre>\n<p>I figure this means that Netbeans is not listening on the correct IP address.  I'm using the Maven AntRun plugin to run remotely and I guess that The Netbeans debugger doesn't know that and thinks I'm debugging locally.</p>\n<p>How can I get Netbeans debugger to listen to the remote IP address??</p>\n<p>I can manually attach the debugger to 192.168.1.168:56821 and debug but I want to have this setup so I just click the debug button and it defaults to the remote platform IP. This is how it works for Netbeans ANT projects.</p>\n"
