    "title": "Springboot Opentelemetry service name",
    "body": "<p>We are using Springboot and micrometer based implementation for Opentelemetry with Jaeger as the collector. Everything works as expected in terms of sending the traces to Jaeger. One of the requirements is to change the name of a service being sent to Jaeger. From the docs, it looks like setting the SPRING_APPLICATION_NAME should work but it isn't. I have also tried setting spring.application.name in the application.yaml file with no luck.</p>\n<p>Any one else experienced this issue and any idea why?</p>\n<p>Thank you in advance!</p>\n"
