    "body": "<p>I am developing an automation script using java and selenium. When I click on a button it opens a new window which buffers continuously and an alert popup is there. Until I accept the alert popup the window buffers, when I click on Ok then window is loaded.Now the thing is using window handles method, selenium is not able to identify the second window as it is not loaded.</p>\n<p>I tried adding delay in the code before using <code>get.windowhandles()</code> method, but nothing works.\nhow can I switch to this window?</p>\n"
