    "title": "The difference between Absolute path and Path with a root component in Java documentation of Path.resolve()",
    "body": "<p>I have been learning about file system management in Java. I came across the documentation of the resolve method under Path interface. I did not understand the difference between a path being absolute and its having a root component. Aren't they the same?</p>\n<p>From the documentation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Path resolve(Path other)</p>\n<p>Resolve the given path against this path.</p>\n<p><strong>If the other parameter is an absolute path then this method trivially returns other</strong>. If other is an empty path then this method trivially returns this path. Otherwise this method considers this path to be a directory and resolves the given path against this path. In the simplest case, the given path does not have a root component, in which case this method joins the given path to this path and returns a resulting path that ends with the given path. <strong>Where the given path has a root component then resolution is highly implementation dependent and therefore unspecified.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I thought that they mean the same and searched on the net but found nothing.</p>\n"
