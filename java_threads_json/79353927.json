    "title": "Are there any differences between Checked and Unchecked Exceptions at Runtime?",
    "body": "<p>Checked Exceptions are powerful because they allow you to force the use-site to deal with an exceptional case. If the use-site does not handle an exceptional case (or publically announce that they are not handling it), then the code will fail to compile.</p>\n<p>However, that's compile time. What about Runtime?</p>\n<p>Are there any meaningful differences between Checked and Unchecked Exceptions at Runtime?</p>\n<p>The only thing I can think of is that Unchecked Exceptions extend <code>RuntimeException</code>, but I don't see any properties about <code>RuntimeException</code> that would allow it to be treated differently at RUNTIME.</p>\n"
