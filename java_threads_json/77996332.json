    "title": "Why am I able to run a Java file using the &quot;java&quot; program without first compiling using &quot;javac&quot;?",
    "body": "<p>I have just started to learn JAVA, I am not from CS background. So far I have understood Java scripts needs two step compilation (compile time and Run time).  (javac File_name.java). This will create a .class file which is platform independent bytecode. Further if i Use (java File_name), it will execute the program. Recently I have notice if I simply use (java File_name.java), I am getting the output. Even I have checked my directory there is no .class file generated. Can anyone please explain why this is happening. If a bytecode is getting generated, then where can i find it?\nNote: I have used the path for java.exe<br />\n<img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/i2QiF.png\" alt=\"cmd.exe\" /></p>\n<p>I tried ,&lt;directory of source code&gt; java File_name.java</p>\n<p>I expected some errors</p>\n<p>i got the output</p>\n"
