    "title": "Gradle - &quot;no main manifest attribute&quot; in sample project",
    "body": "<p>I'm currently taking my first steps in Java and Gradle. When I run gradle init and choose application, Gradle generates a simple hello world sample. I can build it, but when I try to run <code>java -jar app/build/libs/App.jar</code> I get the error <em>no main manifest attribute, in app/build/libs/app.jar</em>. The manifest file inside the jar is indeed empty (except for the line <em>Manifest-Version: 1.0</em>).</p>\n<p>I did find out, that I need to set the main class in Gradles build script, but the sample project already contains that setting.\nThis is the complete build script that was generated by gradle. I haven't made any changes.</p>\n<pre><code>/*\n * This file was generated by the Gradle 'init' task.\n *\n * This generated file contains a sample Java application project to get you started.\n * For more details on building Java &amp; JVM projects, please refer to https://docs.gradle.org/8.14.3/userguide/building_java_projects.html in the Gradle documentation.\n */\n\nplugins {\n    // Apply the application plugin to add support for building a CLI application in Java.\n    application\n}\n\nrepositories {\n    // Use Maven Central for resolving dependencies.\n    mavenCentral()\n}\n\ndependencies {\n    // Use JUnit Jupiter for testing.\n    testImplementation(libs.junit.jupiter)\n\n    testRuntimeOnly(&quot;org.junit.platform:junit-platform-launcher&quot;)\n\n    // This dependency is used by the application.\n    implementation(libs.guava)\n}\n\n// Apply a specific Java toolchain to ease working on different environments.\njava {\n    toolchain {\n        languageVersion = JavaLanguageVersion.of(21)\n    }\n}\n\napplication {\n    // Define the main class for the application.\n    mainClass = &quot;org.example.App&quot;\n}\n\ntasks.named&lt;Test&gt;(&quot;test&quot;) {\n    // Use JUnit Platform for unit tests.\n    useJUnitPlatform()\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I can run the project using <em>gradlew run</em>. I assume, it uses the tar and zip files that are generated in addition to the jar file. Those contain a run script that start java and specify the main class in the command line. But I hope there is a way to get a regular executable jar file.</p>\n"
