    "body": "<p>I noticed that Ignite seems to allow SQL querying (with <a href=\"https://www.gridgain.com/sdk/latest/javadoc/org/apache/ignite/cache/query/SqlFieldsQuery.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">SqlFieldsQuery</a>) of a cache say cache A from a different cache say cache B's <a href=\"https://www.gridgain.com/sdk/latest/javadoc/org/apache/ignite/IgniteCache.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">IgniteCache</a> reference.</p>\n<p>I can understand join queries, but shouldn't Ignite validate &amp; fail execution of SQL queries that don't operate at all on the associated Ignite Cache (the <a href=\"https://www.gridgain.com/sdk/latest/javadoc/org/apache/ignite/IgniteCache.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">IgniteCache</a> reference/handle on which the query is being submitted for execution)? Or am I missing something?</p>\n<p>Thanks</p>\n"
