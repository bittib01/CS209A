    "title": "Launching a jar by directly loading jar bytes in memory from a graal native image and launching the application no disk writes",
    "body": "<p>I'm building an application launcher using GraalVM native image. The launcher downloads an encrypted JAR, decrypts it in memory, and needs to launch it without ever touching the disk. Security requirement - the decrypted application code should never be written anywhere. Is it possible to load the full jar?</p>\n<p>What I've tried (all failed):</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Direct ClassLoader approach - Doesn't work, native-image has no bytecode interpreter</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Embedding JVM via JNI -Too complex and wasted a full day, and it never worked and i did not see or understand what was wrong and where and won't try this again due to jni unless some guides me. Technically possible, but it is a nightmare to work with it.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Writing temp JAR and spawning <strong><code>java -jar</code></strong> - Works perfectly BUT defeats the entire purpose (JAR is on disk, even if briefly), this is currently for testing my app.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I'm bundling a JRE means the launcher will download if not found on the user's machine, same as the jar from my server, so I can spawn Java processes. I just need a way to tell that JVM process, &quot;here's a JAR in memory, load it&quot; without writing files.</p>\n<p>How do enterprise apps handle this? Game launchers, IDE updaters, etc - they must have solved this problem, right?</p>\n<p>I love Java, but here I just don't like it. I can not compile it to a full native image as some libs don't support it, which I have in my jar.  Also, all methods of loading by defineClass work in ide but without jvm can not work in a native image.</p>\n<p>Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! I really need help from you all legends.</p>\n"
