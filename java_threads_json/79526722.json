    "title": "Android Drawable Importer Broken (Again) in Android Studio Meerkat 2024.3.1",
    "body": "<p>Well, it's that time again that IntelliJ released a new version of Android Studio and broke our plugins. Now, with the new Android Studio, although the plugin is enabled but you won't able to see it in your <code>Tools</code> or <code>Right Click Menu</code>.</p>\n<p>I am using MPArnold and Skeaner's forked fixes <a href=\"https://github.com/Skeaner/android-drawable-importer-intellij-plugin\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Since the accessibility of ChatGPT and Claude AI, I thought I can take a swing at fixing it. I've actually managed update the dependencies and made the project runnable, even able to launch a project and I tried exporting it into Android Studio Meerkat.</p>\n<p>But, the problem persist and I didn't realised how frustrating it can be working on IntelliJ plugins. No useful logs and virtually no documentations.</p>\n<p>I've consolidated <a href=\"https://github.com/MPArnold/android-drawable-importer-intellij-plugin\" rel=\"noreferrer\">MPArnold's</a> and <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/users/16639801/user16639801\">Skeaner's</a> solutions in this forked <a href=\"https://github.com/delacrixmorgan/android-drawable-importer-intellij-plugin/tree/feature/meerkat-fix\" rel=\"noreferrer\">feature/meerkat-fix</a> branch I have.</p>\n<p>Could someone help to look into it? Android Drawable Importer plugin has been incredibly useful to my workflow and I wish to maintain it however I can.</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n"
