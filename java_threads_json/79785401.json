    "title": "How do I use createNativeQuery in Hibernate 7 now the simple single parameter version is deprecated?",
    "body": "<p>I have a large project sitting on top of a large database with multiple tables. Data gets inserted, updated, queried (including joins) and deleted. Up to and including Hibernate 6, I've been using <code>createNativeQuery</code> for some of these operations, particularly when the returned results are complex (e.g. <code>&quot;select a.something,b.somethingelse from table1 a left join  table 2 b on (b.thisfield=a.thatfield) where (a.anotherfield in (select anotherfield from table3 where somedate&gt;=:adate))&quot;</code>)</p>\n<p>Up until now, I could do that just by calling <code>.createNativeQuery(sqlstring)</code>, set the parameters, execute and then read the results using <code>ResultSet</code> and <code>.getInt</code>, <code>.getString</code> etc.</p>\n<p>Now, apparently, I have to supply a class - yet I'm not actually wanting to create a new table, this is a set of fields from different tables! How on earth do I do what I'm trying to do?</p>\n<p>This is a simple example - the real queries are far more complex, and there are lots of them... All the examples I find online are either for ridiculously simple single table cases (e.g. <code>.createNativeQuery(&quot;select * from customers&quot;,Customer.class)</code>) or date back years to when just <code>.createNativeQuery(sqlstring)</code> was still allowed.</p>\n<p>(Additionally, I'd like to know what class I should be using when the query doesn't actually return anything anyway, e.g. a <code>delete from...</code> or <code>update... set... where...</code>)</p>\n<p>Thanks for any pointers!</p>\n"
