    "body": "<p>Is Kafka consumer heartbeat message same as consumer poll and commit? Or does it run on a separate thread and keeps sending heartbeat to Kafka broker as long as the consumer JVM is responding?</p>\n<p>The last line the shown paragraph looks confusing to me though<img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/M6OnRoAp.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></p>\n<p>Doesn't it indicate that Heartbeat is somehow linked to the consumer poll and commits?  if so how?</p>\n"
