    "title": "Behavior of IBM MQ when Backout threshold is 0",
    "body": "<p>I have a simple Java application listening to an IBM MQ queue in an asynchronous manner with the acknowledgement mode set as AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE.</p>\n<p>The BACKOUT_THRESHOLD for the queue is set as 0. In the event that I throw a runtime exception in the onMessage method, I observed that the message is continuously redelivered to the consumer (as expected). However in the case that the consumer application crashes/or is stopped, the message is not returned back to the input queue.</p>\n<p>When testing with non-zero BACKOUT_THRESHOLDS, I observed that the message is returned to the input queue when the application crashes as long as the BACKOUT_THRESHOLDS is not exceeded.</p>\n<p>Therefore, why is this behavior inconsistent when the BACKOUT_THRESHOLD is 0? I would expect the message to be returned to the input queue if the application crashes as 0 implies infinite retries? And is there any way to configure this behavior? (To return the messages that are not acknowledged back to the input queue infinitely without routing them to a different Backout queue).</p>\n"
