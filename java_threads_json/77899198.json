    "title": "Android: threads freezing when Runnables contain animations on singleThreadExecutor",
    "body": "<p>I am creating an Idle fighting game through Android Studio Java which requires running a lot of attacking/general combat animations in sequence. I am using ExecutorService instantiated through SingleThreadExecutor to execute Runnables containing animation code.</p>\n<p>Example code excerpt:</p>\n<pre><code>//list of animations to run.\nLinkedList&lt;Runnable&gt; animationTasks = new LinkedList&lt;&gt;();\n\n//example add an animation to the list.\nanimationTasks.add(animateMissOnTarget(target));\n\n//how the animations are executed in sequence.\nExecutorService executor = newSingleThreadExecutor();\nfor (Runnable animation : animationTasks) {\n    executor.execute(animation);\n}\n\n\n//example animation runnable.\nprivate Runnable animateMissOnTarget(String target) {\n    return new Runnable() {\n        @Override\n        public void run() {\n            View targetCombatantView = combatantViewLookup.get(target);\n\n            ImageView missImageView = targetCombatantView.findViewById(R.id.combatant_miss_image);\n\n            missImageView.post(()-&gt; {\n                missImageView.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);\n                ((AnimationDrawable) missImageView.getBackground()).start();\n            });\n\n            try {\n                sleep(combatSpeed);\n            } catch (InterruptedException e) {\n                e.printStackTrace();\n                findViewById(R.id.interrupted).setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);\n            }\n\n            missImageView.post(()-&gt; {\n                missImageView.setVisibility(View.INVISIBLE);\n                ((AnimationDrawable) missImageView.getBackground()).stop();\n            });\n        }\n    };\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Sometimes (although rarely) the App's main (UI) thread freezes and stops responding which is a pretty big bug for a game to have.</p>\n<p>Unsure if I've done this in a very silly way. Does anyone know if there's a better way through Android to display lots of animations in a row rather than the method I am going with?</p>\n<p>Thanks all :)</p>\n<p>I have rewritten the code multiple times to reduce dynamic loading of drawables and such which has reduced the frequency of the bug, however it still persists so I am wondering if it is something more core to Android OS, like the OS killing off threads to save CPU etc</p>\n"
