    "title": "Planning entity with multiple planning variables will not try some scenarios forever",
    "body": "<p>There are two planning variables A and B in one planning entity C. And there are some relationships between A and B:\nrelationship1: when A is in scope (A1 ... A10), B must be in scope (B1 ... B3).\nrelationship2: when A is in scope (A11 ... A15), B must be in scope (B4).</p>\n<p>And now we use value range providers in C:</p>\n<pre><code>class C{\n  @PlanningVariable private A a;\n\n  @ValueRangeProvider private List&lt;A&gt; aScope; //A1 ... A15\n\n  @PlanningVariable\n  private B b;\n\n  @ValueRangeProvider private List&lt;B&gt; bScope; // B1 ... B4\n}\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>we use a hardConstraint constraintD to constrain the above relationships.\nBut we found in Debug log:\nif there is a planning entity c, c.a == A1, c.b == B1:\nwhen timefold doing moving, it will try change c.a = A11, but c.b is still B1 so that it will break hard constraint D, so this move will not be accepted.\nSuch and such, it will not try to change c from relationship1 to relationship2.</p>\n<p>we try to use the unionMoveSelector, but it still not work on above scenario.</p>\n<p>are there any suggestion about this problem?</p>\n"
