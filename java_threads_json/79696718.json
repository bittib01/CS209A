    "title": "Deleting files based on input to avoid accessing parent folders",
    "body": "<p>I am doing a REST API in Java (although this question may apply to other languages) where I create several local files and directories, and they can be deleted based on input. I manage my files in a certain directory, then append the request subpath.</p>\n<p>So, if user sends a request DELETE /data { path: &quot;user23/mobile&quot; }, then I would delete files under &quot;/opt/my-app/user-data/user23/mobile/&quot;. However, It is easy to see that if the input was something like &quot;..&quot; I would start deleting files from other users, or even system files.</p>\n<p>Is there a way to securize the path construction, and make sure the given String does not have access previous folders?</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance.</p>\n"
