    "body": "<p>I want to store a BCrypt-hashed password in application.properties for datasource.password and establish a MySQL database connection. Is this feasible? Is there any way to configure Spring so that I can put a BCrypt-hashed password in application.properties, and Spring internally decrypts it to establish the datasource connection?</p>\n<p>I tried jasypt and cipher but both the way any one can decrypt and get to know the password I don't want like that I want to prevent anyone from decrypting the password, meaning I am looking for a one-way solution, like how BCrypt works, where the password is hashed rather than encrypted.</p>\n"
