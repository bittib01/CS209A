    "title": "I can&#39;t create a new project with java language anymore on Android Studio Hedgehog?",
    "body": "<p>I downloaded android studio latest version Hedgehog, and I found it strange that there is no longer an option to select JAVA languages on the new project screen. Is this a bug? did I do something wrong? Or is there really no more support for the java language in Hedgehog? How can I resolve this?\nThanks for any help! Unfortunately I didn't find any answer to this problem on the internet.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Hs41K.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Hs41K.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>I do not know what to do.</p>\n"
