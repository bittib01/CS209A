    "title": "Configuring Spring Boot with Docker Compose: Selecting a Specific Database Service from Multiple Services",
    "body": "<p>I'm currently facing a challenge with Docker Compose and Spring Boot Docker support. In my <code>compose.yaml</code> file, I've specified two database services, but my intention is to use only one of them, not both. The <code>compose.yaml</code> file is structured as follows:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-yaml prettyprint-override\"><code>version: &quot;3&quot;\n\nservices:\n\n  server:\n    platform: linux/amd64\n    image: mysql:8.0.23\n    ---\n\n  client:\n    platform: linux/amd64\n    image: mysql:8.0.23\n    ---\n</code></pre>\n<p>The reason for having two services is that I plan to utilize the second service for another application. However, in the current setup, when dealing with a single database service, Spring Boot usually configures the <a href=\"https://spring.io/blog/2023/06/19/spring-boot-31-connectiondetails-abstraction\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">connection details</a> automatically. With two services, I'm encountering difficulty in specifying which one to use. The error message I'm receiving is as follows:</p>\n<pre><code>***************************\n\nAPPLICATION FAILED TO START\n\n***************************\n\nDescription:\n\nParameter 1 of method dataSource in org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.jdbc.DataSourceConfiguration$Hikari required a single bean, but 2 were found:\n\n    - jdbcConnectionDetailsForClient_database: defined in unknown location\n\n    - jdbcConnectionDetailsForServer_database: defined in unknown location\n\nThis may be due to missing parameter name information\n\nAction:\n\nConsider marking one of the beans as @Primary, updating the consumer to accept multiple beans, or using @Qualifier to identify the bean that should be consumed\n</code></pre>\n<p>How can I configure my setup to use only one database service and not both? Please note that providing information for only one datasource is not resolving the issue.</p>\n"
