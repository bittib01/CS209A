    "body": "<p>I'm using SerenityBDD on a very mature project, included in this projects we have two different UI application and API tests for a countless amount of services.</p>\n<p>When I'm writing cucumber tests in IntelliJ the dropdown menu appears and it shows every single possible step:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Is there any way to make IntelliJ only show steps for particular application or service?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Or to show an error if you've accidently used a step from the wrong application?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Similarly when you start writing the test, is there any way to specify what steps can come next after a step?\nI.e., the user has logged in and will be on X page, these are all the steps that can be called from that page.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Splitting into separate projects isn't really an option.</p>\n<p>You might be able to tell that the framework I used previously would call methods directly, and with Java it was easy to specify <code>PageObjects</code> in method returns to chain them together.</p>\n<p>It was very easy to write tests and friendly to new people.</p>\n<p>I found the way that serenity/cucumber are doing this to be very unfriendly when it just shows every single step that exists.</p>\n"
