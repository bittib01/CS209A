    "title": "Suspected: JIT deoptimization in Java caused our service sudden performance degradation",
    "body": "<p>Our service runs on JDK17, which is a simple storage query service without complex logic.\nSometimes its rpc interface's TP9999 may experiences a surge (from tens of milliseconds to several seconds or even more than ten seconds), accompanied by 100% CPU utilization.</p>\n<p>This situation often suddenly happens on the stable running machines, and after several seconds it will automatically recover.</p>\n<p><strong>We have found something at the abnormal moments by JFR:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>There is always JIT deoptimization and recompilation occurring which\nwere concentrated on JSON deserialization method(our main business\nlogic is JSON deserialization).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Sometimes it is the C2 compiler thread that has excessive CPU\nusage, while at other times it is the business threads that consume\na high amount of CPU.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I guess the JIT deoptimization may cause the interface's performance decreasing.\nSo what should I do for fixing or reducing this performance problem?</p>\n"
