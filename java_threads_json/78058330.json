However, when running battle with the robot, sentry and an interactive bot, my max FPS is 1-2FPS (read from the output at the top of the screen).</p>\n<p>I'm aware of the FPS slider at the bottom of the screen, and it's currently set to 30 - but this does not move the game above 1-2FPS.\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/bmS2e.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/bmS2e.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>Can anybody suggest a way to improve RoboCode's performance on my machine?</p>\n<p>Running Windows 10 w/DX12 on an Intel Core i7-4930k with 16384MB Ram and a GeForce GTX 760.</p>\n"
