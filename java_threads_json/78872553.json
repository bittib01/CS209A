    "title": "How can I test for an invalid enum type in a switch case?",
    "body": "<p>I'm facing an issue where all the enum values are implemented in the switch statement, and I'm unable to force an UnsupportedOperationException to be thrown. I've read several articles, but nothing work for me</p>\n<p>Here’s the method I want to test:</p>\n<pre><code>public ResponsePaginatedDto execute(DeviceType type) {\n    return switch (type) {\n        case APP -&gt; handleApp();\n        case WEB -&gt; handleWeb();\n        case DESKTOP -&gt; handleDesktop();\n        default -&gt; throw new UnsupportedOperationException();\n    };\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And here's my enum:</p>\n<pre><code>public enum DeviceType {\n    APP,\n    WEB,\n    DESKTOP;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>What I Tried:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Using PowerMockito: I attempted to mock the enum value using PowerMockito to simulate an unsupported value, but I couldn't get it to work as expected.</li>\n<li>Creating a Copy of the Enum in the Test Package: I tried creating a copy of the DeviceType enum within the test package to introduce an unsupported value, but this approach didn't work either, as it led to conflicts and didn't feel like a clean solution.</li>\n<li>Introducing an Invalid Enum Value: I considered adding an invalid enum value just for testing purposes, but I feel that this isn't a good practice since it would artificially inflate the enum solely for testing, which could lead to confusion and maintenance issues in the future.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What I Was Expecting:\nI was expecting to find a way to test the UnsupportedOperationException without having to modify the original enum or introduce artificial values. My goal was to find a method that would allow me to simulate an unsupported enum value and trigger the exception in a clean and maintainable way.</p>\n"
