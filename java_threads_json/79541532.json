    "title": "Breakpoint on method call for one instance",
    "body": "<p>(Java, Eclipse) I have a variable instance on which I call a method (like o.setValue(...) ) in between this and the output, something, somewhere (in the very complex legacy codebase with custom Annotations &amp; Bindings and Reflection) calls the .setValue() method from some superclass.</p>\n<pre><code>var i = ...;\ni.setValue(true); //setValue() Inherited from some superclass\ni.getValue()==true\n[Framework / Reflection / Annotation magic]\ni.getValue()!=true; //where was setValue() called on my instance?\n</code></pre>\n<p>I want to find out where. Thus, I want to set a conditional breakpoint (in Eclipse, Java) that tiggers exactly if my Instances setValue() method is called. How can I do that?</p>\n<p>I did try a conditional Breakpoint, but the condition is evaluated in the scope of .setValue(), and my instance usually doesn't have any special properties, because it's before a complex change or the values are too general (null or true etc.).</p>\n<p>The easiest/ most elegant/ general way would be via its address, but that value is in a different scope/Module.</p>\n<p>Thus, how would I get my instance address into the Breakpoint condition, and accessible in all Modules/scopes.</p>\n"
