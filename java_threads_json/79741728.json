    "title": "Eclipse AutoComplete Not Matching JDK Version",
    "body": "<p>I am currently using the latest version of Eclipse IDE and have my project setup to use JDK8, however when I attempt to use the autocomplete it provides suggestions from future compiler versions. This can get really annoying as every time that I need to rely on the autocomplete, I have to double check the Javadoc information to see if it is compatible. What settings do I need to change to force eclipse to only show  &lt;JDK8 suggestions?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/539oT0ZH.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/539oT0ZH.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/wiG4baNY.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/wiG4baNY.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n"
