    "title": "How to add Columns from Junction table to the Child",
    "body": "<p>I am working with Spring Boot JPA Hibernate.\nI have @ManyToMany relationship and Junction Table.\nOne Entity is called Entity and the other Button.\nAnd then Junction Table is called ENTITY_BUTTONS</p>\n<p>This Junction Table has some additional Columns.\nWhen I get a List of Button Children I would also like these additional columns to be included. But I am not sure how to do that.</p>\n<p>So basically I don't want just a list of children but list of some other structure that will contains columns from the child and additional Columns from Junction Table for that Child relation.</p>\n<p>My goal is to just be able to get top Entitiy and then that all the other entities and their children are automatically picked up in a complete hierarchy.</p>\n<pre><code>@javax.persistence.Entity\n@Table(name = &quot;ENTITIES&quot;)\npublic class Entity {\n\n    @ManyToMany(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)\n    @WhereJoinTable( clause = &quot;active = true and is_deleted = false&quot;)\n    @JoinTable(\n        name               = &quot;ENTITY_BUTTONS&quot;,\n        joinColumns        = @JoinColumn(name = &quot;ENTITY_ID&quot;),\n        inverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = &quot;BUTTON_ID&quot;)\n    )\n    private List&lt;Button&gt; buttons;\n\n}\n\n\n@Entity\n@Table(name = &quot;BUTTONS&quot;)\npublic class Button  { ... }\n</code></pre>\n"
