    "title": "Response 403 forbidden at simultaneously ajax request using Jakarta EE and Glassfish Server",
    "body": "<p>I have a Jakarta-based web app deployed in Glassfish 7.0.16. Currently, I'm implementing Jakarta Security with user-role from DB. That works fine until the client-side execute multiple ajax requests at the same time, it starts responding <em>403 forbidden</em> beginning from 2° or 3° ajax request. Actually, it occurs sometimes around 3 of 10 times.</p>\n<p>I've tried to change security settings as <code>&lt;security-role&gt;</code> in web.xml, <code>@ServletSecurity</code> in Servlet file, and <code>@inject SecurityContext</code> into Servlet class</p>\n<p>I removed <code>@ServletSecurity</code> in my Servlet class and wrote a filter, where I inject <code>SecurityContext</code> and checks as follow:</p>\n<pre><code>public class AuthorizationFilter implements Filter {\n\n @Inject\n SecurityContext sc;\n\n public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain) {\n\n  HttpServletRequest req = (HttpServletRequest) request;\n  HttpServletResponse res = (HttpServletResponse) response;\n\n  if (req.isUserInRole(&quot;ROLE_A&quot;) || sc.isCallerInRole(&quot;ROLE_A&quot;)) {\n   doChain(request, response);\n  } else {\n   // log info about Principal and session attributes\n  }\n }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Like I mentioned above, if the client-side make 6 simultaneously ajax requests, one of them will respond <em>403 forbidden.</em> Checking the generated log within <code>else</code> fragment, all session attributes and Principal are there like the another 5 ajax requests.</p>\n<p>Some idea of what it is happening?</p>\n"
