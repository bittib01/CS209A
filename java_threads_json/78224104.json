    "title": "Example of Code with and without strictfp Modifier",
    "body": "<p>I know this question might seem overly familiar to the community, but I swear I've never been able to reproduce the issue related to this question even once throughout my programming journey.</p>\n<p>I understand what the <code>strictfp</code> modifier does and how it ensures full compliance with the <strong>IEEE754</strong> standard. However, I've never encountered a situation in practice where the set of values with an extended exponent is used, as described in the official specification.</p>\n<p>I've tried using options like <code>-XX:+UseFPUForSpilling</code> to stimulate the use of the <strong>FPU block</strong> for calculations on my relatively modern processor, but it had no effect.</p>\n<p>I even went as far as installing <strong>Windows 98 SE</strong> on a virtual machine and emulating an <strong>Intel Pentium II</strong> processor through <strong>Bochs</strong>, which does not support the <strong>SSE instruction set</strong>, hoping that the use of the <strong>FPU block</strong> in this case would be virtually the only option. However, even such an experiment yielded no results.</p>\n<p>The essence of the experiment was to take the maximum possible value of the <code>double</code> type and multiply it by 2 to take the intermediate result beyond the permissible range of the <code>double</code> type. Then, I divided the obtained value by 4, and the final result was saved back into a <code>double</code> variable. In theory, I should have gotten some more meaningful result, but in all situations, I ended up with <code>Infinity</code>. In general, I haven't found a single reproducible example on the entire internet (even as of 2024!) that would show different results with and without the use of <code>strictfp</code>. Is it really possible that in almost 30 years of the language's history, there isn't a single example on this topic that clearly demonstrates the difference?</p>\n<p>P.S. I'm well aware of <strong>Java 17+</strong>. All experiments were conducted on earlier versions, where the difference should, in theory, be observable. I installed <strong>Java SE 1.3</strong> on the virtual machine.</p>\n"
