    "title": "Testing ExecutorService with Mockito",
    "body": "<p>There are smiliar questions to this but they don't quite cover the answer I need, so could anyone help a real noob to Java and Mockito? I have code as part of a larger method in a class like so:</p>\n<pre><code>private final ExecutorService executorService; //(also declared in constructor)\n\n\nexecutorService.submit(() -&gt; {\n      someCool.stuffInHere\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>And I would like to unit test it with something along the lines of</p>\n<pre><code>@Mock\nExecutorService executorServiceMock\n\ndoAnswer(invocationOnMock -&gt; {\n    testSomeCoolStuffInHere;\n}).when(executorServiceMock).submit(() -&gt; any())\n</code></pre>\n<p>Is that a correct way to go about it?  I'm trying that but I keep getting an error along the lines of:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-none prettyprint-override\"><code>executorServiceMock.submit(CLassName$$LongLambdaAddress) at ClassName\nhas following stubbings with different arguments\n\n1. executorServiceMock.submit(CLassName$$ADifferentLongLambdaAddress)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Thanks for looking.  hopefully there's enough info there.  I'm hoping it's something simple.</p>\n"
