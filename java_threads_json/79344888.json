    "body": "<p>I am creating a Java application where I need to read google sheets, create objects from the row values and store them in the database.\nThe problem is that I need to read not the whole sheet (tens of thousands rows) but only rows that are highlighted with certain colors.\nI did not find in the google docs how to set up this search criteria.\nIf someone has done something similar, I will appreciate some pointers.</p>\n"
