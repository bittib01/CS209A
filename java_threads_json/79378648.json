    "body": "<p>I was following Client Credentials flow guide from <a href=\"https://www.baeldung.com/spring-webclient-oauth2#spring-security-5-support---the-client-credentials-flow\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Baeldung</a>, one question that occurred to me was - what would happen if during the initial request, when no Token was cached, a second request was received in the application. Would Spring send a second request to authenticate?</p>\n<p>I went as far as debugging my application and looked at <code>ClientCredentialsOAuth2AuthorizedClientProvider</code> implementation, but couldn't find any locking mechanism and I didn't know where to look from there.</p>\n"
