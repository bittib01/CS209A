    "body": "<p>This question is specific to AWS Managed Flink (1.19).\nI know how to control logging in most Java apps,\nbut everything I know is failing in this case.</p>\n<p>I have a Java application running in Amazon Managed Service for Apache Flink (MSF).<br />\nMSF uses log4j2, and they allow you configure the global log level,<br />\nbut I don't see a way to set the log level on individual classes and packages.<br />\nI have tried providing my own <code>log4j2.xml</code> but it appears to be ignored.<br />\nThe same with setting various environment variables.<br />\nAll I really want is for 3rd party code to log at WARN<br />\nbut still have my code log at DEBUG.<br />\nI can't find any docs for this, but I hope if someone can provide<br />\nexactly the right flag or env var that I can control it.</p>\n"
