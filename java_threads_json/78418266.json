    "body": "<p>I recently upgraded to IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate 2024.1.1 and encountered an issue with the Checkstyle plugin. My project uses a specific version of Checkstyle defined in checkstyle.xml which isn't compatible with the versions pre-filled in the Checkstyle configuration window of IntelliJ.</p>\n<p>Previously, there was an option to add a custom Checkstyle version by pointing to a downloaded .jar file, but this option seems to be missing in the latest version of the plugin or IDE.</p>\n<p>Here’s what I’ve tried:</p>\n<p>Looking for an option to add a custom Checkstyle version in the plugin settings (no such option exists now).\nChecking IntelliJ’s documentation and forums for any updates regarding Checkstyle integration (found no relevant information).</p>\n<p>I am looking for a way to integrate my specific Checkstyle version directly into IntelliJ to continue using the IDE’s Checkstyle functionalities. Does anyone know of a method to manually add a Checkstyle version in IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate 2024.1.1, or is there an alternative approach to handle this situation effectively?</p>\n"
