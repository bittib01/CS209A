    "title": "What is correct way to use Hibernate, generate tables using entity or generate tables using db sql file",
    "body": "<p>I am working on the application which have 10-15 tables and I will using Hibernate for database access.\nNow the question I have is, how to create a database for such application?\nShould I let hibernate crate database by defining the entities or keep control of database with me by using schema.sql and data.sql.</p>\n<p>If I let hibernate create tables, it always causes issues in future if database design changes. That is why I am inclined to use schema.sql and data.sql.</p>\n<p>I mean, is there any best practice?\nHow to approach the design of the application, from database view or Java object view?</p>\n<p>I read lot of questions on stackoverflow but there is no clean answer for the question.\nI am looking for any link or topic where it is discussed.</p>\n<p>I know both the way will work fine. I have found some comments which says the relation is DB is not necessay if you are using hibernate like <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/37925244/20688290\">https://stackoverflow.com/a/37925244/20688290</a> and <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/5204600/20688290\">https://stackoverflow.com/a/5204600/20688290</a> which says there is no need to maintain any relation in DB if using Hibernate.</p>\n"
