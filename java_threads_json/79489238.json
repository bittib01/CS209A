    "body": "<p>Snowflake has thin, standard(thick?) and FIPS Java JDBC drivers.  I don't need FIPS.</p>\n<p>I had assumed that thin means lightweight, without required jars, and thick would be heavy and include any dependent jars.</p>\n<p>Thus thin would be better if you want to make the app faster to load and have fewer dependency conflicts.</p>\n<p>However, I have seen discussions about Oracle type 1 to 4 drivers which seem to imply the opposite.</p>\n<p>What is the difference, and which should I choose for a Spring Boot app connecting directly to Snowflake via JDBC?</p>\n<h2>Update 1</h2>\n<p>I have tried both Snowflake drivers.  Maven could not resolve all the dependencies required for the &quot;thin&quot; driver, so to save time I went with their &quot;standard&quot; one which works out of the box with Maven + Spring Boot.</p>\n"
