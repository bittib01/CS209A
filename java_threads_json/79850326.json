    "title": "How can I increase JaCoCo coverage by excluding files",
    "body": "<p>If you exclude files with 0% coverage from the JaCoCo plugin, then coverage will not increase</p>\n<p>Why does JaCoCo count coverage percents by files that I set to be excluded?</p>\n<p>It gets all files in project (including excluded files) and gets all files with any coverage and divide them. But it seems to be, that JaCoCo must get not all files in project, but all included files (or that does not contain in excluded).</p>\n<p>Why such a behaviour? And is there any solution to ignore excluded files from total coverage calculation?</p>\n<p>For example, I get 10% coverage, and then I exclude some files that not covered (and they must not be covered), after <code>mvn jacoco clean install</code>, I also get 10% coverage. I need to calculate coverage only for certain classes.</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-xml prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;plugin&gt;\n    &lt;groupId&gt;org.jacoco&lt;/groupId&gt;\n    &lt;artifactId&gt;jacoco-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n    &lt;version&gt;0.8.10&lt;/version&gt;\n    &lt;configuration&gt;\n        &lt;excludes&gt;\n            &lt;exclude&gt;**/some/excluded/dirs/**/*&lt;/exclude&gt;\n        &lt;/excludes&gt;\n    &lt;/configuration&gt;\n\n    &lt;executions&gt;\n        &lt;execution&gt;\n            &lt;id&gt;prepare-agent&lt;/id&gt;\n            &lt;goals&gt;\n                &lt;goal&gt;prepare-agent&lt;/goal&gt;\n            &lt;/goals&gt;\n        &lt;/execution&gt;\n        &lt;execution&gt;\n            &lt;id&gt;report&lt;/id&gt;\n            &lt;goals&gt;\n                &lt;goal&gt;report&lt;/goal&gt;\n            &lt;/goals&gt;\n        &lt;/execution&gt;\n    &lt;/executions&gt;\n&lt;/plugin&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>\n<p>Or maybe sonar can increase coverage by exclusion? But in what relation are Jacoco and sonar exclusions? Is there a reason to exclude by Jacoco when i can exclude by sonar?</p>\n"
