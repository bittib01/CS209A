    "title": "Why do we need abstract methods in Enums",
    "body": "<p>I've been studying Java for some time now to better understand what goes on inside some of the code parts.</p>\n<p>While studying <code>Enum</code>, which I am used to using exclusively for listing various fixed values (such as days of the week), I came across something that I didn't quite understand - the implementation of abstract methods within <code>Enum</code>.</p>\n<p>My question is as follows: first, is this mechanism even necessary today? It looks like code smell, although I can't explain why.</p>\n<p>Second, how often is Enum used in this way? I understand that there can always be exceptional cases, but it seems to make the code quite difficult to read.</p>\n<p>Here is an example:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>public enum Operation {\n    ADD {\n        @Override\n        public int apply(int x, int y) {\n            return x + y;\n        }\n    },\n    SUBTRACT {\n        @Override\n        public int apply(int x, int y) {\n            return x  -  y;\n        }\n    };\n    public abstract int apply(int x, int y);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I tried to find a practical use for it and found only one thing - development in Java for Android, and there I generally understand the meaning of the mechanism, but for web development it looks like an outdated mechanism that only spoils the code.</p>\n"
