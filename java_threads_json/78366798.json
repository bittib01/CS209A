    "body": "<p>This is my first question, so please forgive me if I miss anything.</p>\n<p>I scanned my &quot;.exe&quot; file (converted from &quot;.jar&quot; with launch4j )using VirusTotal and found some trojans. Then I scanned my &quot;.jar&quot; file, but it didn't find any threats.</p>\n<p>I coded an application with Java. Then I packaged and converted my application into &quot;.jar&quot; format. Finally, I converted it from &quot;.jar&quot; format to &quot;.exe&quot; format using &quot;launch4j&quot;. My application worked fine on my own computer. However, when I needed to run it on another computer, I received a virus alert from Windows Defender.</p>\n<p>Since I had never encountered such a situation before, I immediately scanned my &quot;.exe&quot; file using VirusTotal and found these three threats: Trojan.Worgtop.Win32.63, W32.AIDetectMalware, Trojan.PSW.Worgtop.ak. Then I scanned my &quot;.jar&quot; file, but it didn't find any threats.</p>\n<p>As a result, I began to suspect whether launch4j might somehow inject these viruses into my &quot;.exe&quot; file during the creation process. Do you think such a scenario is possible?</p>\n<p>I am aware that &quot;W32.AIDetectMalware&quot; is a &quot;(false) positive&quot; threat. However, the other threats are concerning me. I searched for the other threats online, but I couldn't find a definitive answer.</p>\n<p>Finally, how do you recommend converting a &quot;.jar&quot; file to an &quot;.exe&quot; file in the best possible way?</p>\n<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>\n<p>After lots of searching and with <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78366798/ls-launch4j-can-add-trojan-into-exe-file?noredirect=1#comment138160698_78366798\">g00se's suggestion</a>, I found the best way to convert a &quot;.jar&quot; file to an &quot;.exe&quot; file is by using the &quot;jpackage&quot; tool. It's included in the JDK, so it's pretty reliable for this job. Just to clarify, when I talk about reliability, I mean the trustworthiness of the tool itself during the conversion process.</p>\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>\n<p>Following Michael's suggestion, I tried repackaging my &quot;.jar&quot; file using launch4j on a completely different computer. Unfortunately, it seems the result is still the same. I'm afraid those Trojans are being added during the conversion process to &quot;.exe&quot; format. Moreover, even when I tested it using hybrid-analysis, it was still labeled as &quot;malicious&quot;. I wonder, which other open-source software we trust might be causing such issues?</p>\n"
