    "title": "JVM heap size is greater than the container&#39;s memory limit",
    "body": "<p>I run a Java (21) application in my k8s cluster.\nI defined the <code>-Xms</code> and <code>-Xmx</code> values to be 780 mib. <strong>If I set a lower value to <code>-Xmx</code> the application crashes with out of memory error.</strong>\nI set the request and the limit of the container to be 600 mib.\nI expected the app to be terminated with an out of memory error, but the container is running.</p>\n<p>In addition, by using the <code>kubectl top</code> I see that the container is using 545 mib, and indeed when I set a lower limit the app is crashed with OOM.</p>\n<p>How the <code>-Xms</code> and <code>-Xmx</code> are higher than the limit and the container is running?\nI see that defining a lower <code>-Xmx</code> value leads to OOM, so I assume the JVM is actually using it, but when I set the limit to this value (lower than <code>-Xmx</code>) the container runs. How is it possible?</p>\n"
