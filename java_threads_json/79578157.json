    "title": "Have lowercase value from Enum field when sending request with Spring",
    "body": "<p>I would like to send http requests with a lowercase value where in the path variable, the value is taken from an Enum with uppercase values.</p>\n<p>On a very simple code:</p>\n<pre><code>@HttpExchange(accept = &quot;application/json&quot;)\npublic interface FooHttpExchange {\n    \n    @GetExchange(&quot;/api/1.1/{day}/dosomething&quot;)\n    String doSomethingWithDayOfWeek(@PathVariable(&quot;day&quot;) Day day);\n</code></pre>\n<p>with the Enum:</p>\n<pre><code>public enum Day {\n    MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY, SUNDAY\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>As you can see, all values of the enum are uppercase, to respect Java conventions on enumeration.</p>\n<p>But also, I do get the Enums from third-party libraries as well. I cannot change the content of the Enum.</p>\n<p>I would expect to send this as a request (taking Monday as an example):</p>\n<p><code>http://example.com/api/1.1/monday/dosomething</code></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, it is sending this instead:</p>\n<p><code>http://example.com/api/1.1/MONDAY/dosomething</code></p>\n<p>And on the server side, there is a parsing, meaning, it is expecting things in lower case.</p>\n<p>The request fails</p>\n<p>If I were to change the enum to full lowercase, I can confirm the request is then working.</p>\n<p>And sometimes, I get the Enum directly from a third-party library, where I cannot change the code.</p>\n<p>However, this breaks the Java enum convention to have them as uppercase in the code.</p>\n<p>How to have the Java enum as uppercase, but be able to send it as lowercase when sending the http request?</p>\n"
