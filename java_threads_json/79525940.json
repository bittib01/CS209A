    "body": "<p>I am using Saxon 9 in Java to compile XPath expressions like this:</p>\n<pre><code>net.sf.saxon.xpath.XPathEvaluator.compile(expression)\n</code></pre>\n<p>I am aware of the changes between XPath 1 and XPath 2, so I am not surprised that Saxon cannot evaluate expressions like <code>position() = '1'</code>.</p>\n<p>However, is there a way to at least compile, not evaluate the expression?</p>\n<p>It would be much easier and more robust to recursively detect and fix type incompatibilities like the one above in a compiled Expression object, than to rely on string operations and regex.</p>\n"
