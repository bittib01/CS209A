    "title": "Chrome Driver not closing properly and using a lot of CPU",
    "body": "<p>I am currently using Chrome Driver with Serenity BDD and when the tests are done running, it is not closing properly, and it is consuming a lot of CPU. I am unable to run a full regression before my entire PC crashes since already visibly closed chrome instances are still in the task manager consuming my CPU.</p>\n<p>I have tried to play around with the chrome switches like turning off --no-sandbox and --disable-gpu, but those dont seem to work and I am at a bit of a loss.</p>\n"
