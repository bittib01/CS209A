    "body": "<p>I have set JAVA_HOME to C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk-17\nPath: includes %JAVA_HOME%\\bin and I've reinstalled NetBeans 24 and ensured that the setup points to the jdk-17 file, and the Tools\\Java Platforms only lists JDK-17, but I still get the following warning when I clean and build a project using the -Xlint:unchecked option (no errors are actually shown):</p>\n<p>warning: [options] bootstrap class path not set in conjunction with -source 8\nNote: Some input files use unchecked or unsafe operations.</p>\n<p>No harm seems to be done, but I like to remove errors and warning if possible.  Not sure what else I need to set.  Thanks.</p>\n"
