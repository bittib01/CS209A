    "title": "How to highlight the currently playing song in a RecyclerView after returning from another Activity in Android?",
    "body": "<p>I am working on an Android app using Java, and I have a <code>RecyclerView</code> displaying a list of songs. When a song is selected, it starts playing, and the app navigates to a player <code>Activity</code>. After returning to the original fragment with the song list, I want to highlight the currently playing song and display a playing animation (e.g., a GIF) next to it. Additionally, if another song is selected and starts playing, only the newly selected song should be highlighted, and the previous one should return to its default state.</p>\n<h3>Here is what I have done so far</h3>\n<p>I store the currently playing song's details in a <code>SessionManager</code>.\nIn my adapter's <code>onBindViewHolder</code> method, I check if the song is the currently playing one and update the UI accordingly.\nIn the fragment's <code>onResume</code> method, I call <code>notifyDataSetChanged()</code> on the adapter to refresh the UI.</p>\n<p>I am expecting if i change the songs anywhere in the app like from notification or miniplayer the\nin that fragment song highlight is also change for current time.</p>\n"
