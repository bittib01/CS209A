    "title": "BLE Advertising after pairing not working (BlueZ 5.69)",
    "body": "<p>I have the following problem: my goal is to implement a BLE peripheral which first pairs with a device and afterwards advertises services and lets only the paired device access the values of the characteristics.</p>\n<p>So I am using simplePairing mode, and experience the &quot;Command disallowed&quot; error when trying to start advertising when piscan is activated. When I deactivate piscan I am able to advertise but not to find and pair with the device.</p>\n<p>Can you please help me to find the right combination of setting to implement the wished peripheral? Is it even possible?</p>\n<p>I tried almost all combinations and sequences. I tried to set the charcteristic flags to &quot;encrypt-authenticated-read&quot;, &quot;encrypt-authenticated-indicate&quot; to enforce pairing/bonding after connection.</p>\n"
