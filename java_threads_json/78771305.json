    "body": "<p>I've searched for this all over place and have found a lot of answers that don't compile, or use deprecated APIs.  It's a simple thing really that I thought would have been incorporated in the core APIs a while ago:</p>\n<p>I want be able able to click on a Preference and replace the radio button with an ImageView and a TextView per row.  Simple as that.  I would think I should be able to add &quot;entries&quot;, &quot;entryValues&quot;, and &quot;entryImages&quot; into the preferences.xml and I'd have thought that would be supported as I've seen that UX in lots of other applications.  Can't believe it's custom work every time.</p>\n<p>Can someone point me in the right direction?</p>\n<p>This article is getting there, but is incomplete: <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60748852/custom-list-preference-dialog-layout-in-preference-screen-with-custom-list-item\">Custom list preference dialog layout in Preference Screen, with custom list items</a></p>\n<p>Please help!</p>\n<p>I tried the link above and I can easily bring up a custom dialog, I just have to create an adapter to get the data, which I mostly have.  I just can't believe it's this much coding for something so simple.</p>\n"
