    "body": "<p>When opening an OutputStream <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en%2Fjava%2Fjavase%2F11%2Fdocs%2Fapi%2F%2F/java.base/java/nio/file/Files.html#newOutputStream(java.nio.file.Path,java.nio.file.OpenOption...)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">using the Files API</a> you can pass options for it. One of the options is WRITE which is applied by default if no options are specified.\nHowever I fail to see what the difference is when it is provided and when it is not.\nAn outputstream can only be used for writing, no?\nThe docs only mention:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Open for write access.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>An outputstream is per definition always to write content so I fail to so the use for it.\nIn our project (where we had a bug related to the TRUNCATE_EXISTING missing) the WRITE option was not specified but the file was (over)written either anyway.\nTo be clear, what is the difference between:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>// OpenOption.CREATE, OpenOption.TRUNCATE_EXISTING, OpenOption.WRITE\nFiles.newOutputStream(file); \n</code></pre>\n<p>and</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>Files.newOutputStream​(file, OpenOption.CREATE, OpenOption.TRUNCATE_EXISTING);\n</code></pre>\n"
