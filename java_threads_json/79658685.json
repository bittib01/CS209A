    "title": "Apache Camel not shutting down gracefully when an processor task within the route is still in progress",
    "body": "<p>I'm using Apache Camel with Spring Boot to consume and process large XML files from an SFTP location. The route uses <code>.split().parallelProcessing()</code> to handle thousands of  elements in parallel:</p>\n<p>Here’s a simplified version of the route:</p>\n<pre><code>from(&quot;sftp://my-server/path?options...&quot;)\n    .split()\n        .tokenizeXML(&quot;&lt;record&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;/record&gt;&quot;)\n        .streaming()\n        .parallelProcessing()\n        .process(myRecordProcessor)\n    .end();\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Shutdown Configuration</strong>:<br />\nWe are using the default shutdown settings from Apache Camel 4.x:<br />\nTimeout: 45 seconds<br />\nShutdown Now On Timeout: true<br />\nLog Inflight Exchanges On Timeout: true<br />\nShutdown Routes In Reverse Order: true<br />\nThe inflight message tracking works as expected — the Camel context shuts down cleanly after 45 seconds if the message isn’t finished.\nHowever, the problem is that when a large file is being processed, and the <code>.split().parallelProcessing()</code> is still running (processing thousands of parts within a single inflight message), the shutdown cuts off the remaining split records. That means the file is only partially processed, and the rest of the records are lost.</p>\n<p><strong>Question</strong>:<br />\nIs there a way to make Camel wait for internal parallel tasks inside a <code>.split().parallelProcessing()</code> to finish before treating the inflight exchange as done, or delay shutdown until all those tasks complete?</p>\n<p>Any insights or recommended approaches are highly appreciated!</p>\n"
