    "body": "<p>I am using this plugin: <a href=\"https://github.com/jfrog/artifactory-gradle-plugin\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://github.com/jfrog/artifactory-gradle-plugin</a></p>\n<p>And below is a sample of my build.gradle</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-none prettyprint-override\"><code>artifactory {\n    publish {\n        contextUrl = artifactoryUrl\n        repository {\n            repoKey = &quot;repo-1&quot;\n            username = System.getenv(&quot;ARTIFACTORY_USER&quot;) ?: project.findProperty(&quot;artifactory_user&quot;)\n            password = System.getenv(&quot;ARTIFACTORY_PASSWORD&quot;) ?: project.findProperty(&quot;artifactory_password&quot;)\n        }\n        defaults {\n            publications('ALL_PUBLICATIONS')\n            publishBuildInfo = false\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The above task has a name <code>artifactoryPublish</code> and when I run it, its publishing my artifact to repo-1 as defined above. However how should I modify this so it can also publish to repo-2 and repo-3? Is there a way to create a custom task and call the above task in a loop for each of the repos(repo-1, repo-2, repo-3)?</p>\n<p>Note: I checked the docs for above plugin and I dont think they have a built-in way to publish to multiple repositories.</p>\n"
