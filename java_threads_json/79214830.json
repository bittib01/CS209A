    "body": "<p>Over the last couple of days I have read through many similar questions but none that actually answers what I am looking for. Hence , posting this question.</p>\n<p>I have a string, for example:</p>\n<pre><code>    String myString = &quot;Rule2 = if(event = 'Veteran''s Day', 'Day 1', 'Day 2', Measure1.Lag)&quot;; \n</code></pre>\n<p>I want this to be changed to the following:</p>\n<pre><code>    myString = &quot;RULE2=IF(EVENT='Veteran''s Day','Day 1','Day 2', MEASURE1.LAG)&quot;;\n</code></pre>\n<p>That is all text except those within single quotes are trimmed of extra spaces and turned to upperCase().</p>\n<p>I thought I could use regex to extract [Rule2,if,event] and use String.replaceAll() et al. No luck. It is the third day today. My head has stopped working now. Please help.</p>\n<p>Would be grateful for any pointers.</p>\n"
