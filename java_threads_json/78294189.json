    "body": "<blockquote>\n<p>Given an array of positive numbers of size n, pick as many items as possible from this array and multiply by -1, such that the cumulative sum is always greater than 0. Return how many items can be made negative as result.</p>\n<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>\n<p>Test case1 : [5,3,1,2]</p>\n<p>Result = 2</p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<p>pick indices 1 and 2 and make them negative\nso [5,-3,-1,2]\ncumulative sum is [5,2,1,3]</p>\n<p>There are other possibilities also like <code>[5,-3,1,-2]</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My coding approach is like this:</p>\n<pre><code>static int solve(int[] arr) {\n    long sum = 0;\n    int result = 0;\n    for(int e : arr) {\n        int neg = -e;\n        if(sum + neg &gt;0) {\n            result++;\n            sum += neg;\n        } else {\n            sum += e;\n        }\n    }\n    return result;\n} \n</code></pre>\n<p>But my approach is not correct as it gives wrong output for some cases, for example:</p>\n<pre><code>arr = [5,2,3,5,2,3]\n\nExpected output = 3, my code results = 2\n\npossible solution is [5,-2,3,5,-2,-3]\n</code></pre>\n<p>What is the correct approach to solve this?</p>\n"
