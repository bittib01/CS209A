    "title": "What is the correct way to safely stop a Thread in Java without using stop()?",
    "body": "<p>I’m learning about multithreading in Java, and I have a specific question regarding how to safely stop a thread.</p>\n<p>I know that the stop() method is deprecated and unsafe because it can leave objects in an inconsistent state or cause security issues, so I want to avoid using it.</p>\n<p>My goal is to stop a running thread when a certain condition is met (for example, when a button is pressed or a time limit is reached), but I want to do it cleanly and without causing runtime errors or unexpected behavior.</p>\n<p>I’ve seen some examples where a boolean flag is used to control whether the thread should keep running, but I still have some questions:</p>\n<p>Is using a flag the recommended approach?</p>\n<p>How do I properly implement this pattern?</p>\n<p>What happens if the thread is sleeping or waiting when I try to stop it?</p>\n<p>Are there better or more modern alternatives, such as using ExecutorService?</p>\n<p>I appreciate any clear explanation, simple examples, or best practices to follow. I'm just trying to learn how to do this the right way, in a safe and clean manner.</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance!</p>\n"
