    "body": "<p>I'm trying to run a Java/Maven project that apparently works for others, but VS Code won't run this Spring Boot project because:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The import <code>org.springframework.data</code> cannot be resolved.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><code>import org.springframework.data.repository.CrudRepository</code></p>\n<p>However, my POM has the dependency that includes that class:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-xml prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;dependency&gt;\n    &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;\n    &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-data-jpa&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>And the <code>spring-boot-starter-parent</code> the project uses is at v2.7.14.</p>\n<p>I have the Java extension pack for VS Code.</p>\n<p>I've tried <code>mvn clean.</code> There's no &quot;reload project&quot; option as some things have said, but I thought I read that VS Code does that when <code>pom.xml</code> changes, so I've tried that.</p>\n<p>I'm sure it's something simple I'm not doing right, but I can't for the life of me figure it out.</p>\n"
