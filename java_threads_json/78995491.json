    "title": "Selenium test build fails on Jenkins",
    "body": "<p>I created Jenkins job and trying to launch a selenium test(java), but the build keeps failing with the following error. Both, Jenkins primary and agent machines are on AWS. Everything works perfectly on local machine, but fails on the agent machine. It looks like testng version defined in gradle build file is not compatible with Java version that is being used on the agent machine. Checked Java version on agent and it is correct one.</p>\n<p>Is it because the path to Java needs to be indicated somewhere in Gradle properties file or in Jenkins configuration?</p>\n<pre><code>&gt; &gt; Task :compileJava FAILED\n&gt; \n&gt; FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.\n&gt; \n&gt; * What went wrong: Execution failed for task ':compileJava'.\n&gt; &gt; Could not resolve all files for configuration ':compileClasspath'.\n&gt;    &gt; Could not resolve org.testng:testng:7.7.1.\n&gt;      Required by:\n&gt;          project :\n&gt;       &gt; No matching variant of org.testng:testng:7.7.1 was found. The consumer was configured to find a library for use during compile-time,\n&gt; compatible with Java 9, preferably in the form of class files,\n&gt; preferably optimized for standard JVMs, and its dependencies declared\n&gt; externally but:\n&gt;           - Variant 'antApiElements' capability org.testng:testng-ant:7.7.1 declares a library for use during\n&gt; compile-time, packaged as a jar, and its dependencies declared\n&gt; externally:\n&gt;               - Incompatible because this component declares a component, compatible with Java 11 and the consumer needed a\n&gt; component, compatible with Java 9\n&gt;               - Other compatible attribute:\n&gt;                   - Doesn't say anything about its target Java environment (preferred optimized for standard JVMs)\n&gt;           - Variant 'antRuntimeElements' capability org.testng:testng-ant:7.7.1 declares a library for use during runtime,\n&gt; packaged as a jar, and its dependencies declared externally:\n&gt;               - Incompatible because this component declares a component, compatible with Java 11 and the consumer needed a\n&gt; component, compatible with Java 9\n&gt;               - Other compatible attribute:\n&gt;                   - Doesn't say anything about its target Java environment (preferred optimized for standard JVMs)\n      \n</code></pre>\n<p>Added this line into <code>gradle-wrapper.properties</code>: <code>org.gradle.java.home=/home/jenkins/jdk</code></p>\n<p>Added properties file in Jenkins configuration with Java home path, however nothing from the above has helped.</p>\n"
