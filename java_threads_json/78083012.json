    "body": "<p>I need to install Java 6 on a Mac running OSX 14.3.1 (Sonoma) for one work project.</p>\n<p>Oracle doesn't have a Java 6 download for Mac.</p>\n<p>The Apple Support installer won't install Java 6 if I have other versions of Java installed (I have 11, 13 and 17).</p>\n<p>I don't want to uninstall the other versions of Java, I will need them for parallel work projects.</p>\n<p>I suppose I can move / delete / uninstall the newer versions, install Java 6, and then reinstall / move back the newer versions, but I have concerns that this may fail.</p>\n<p>Has anyone managed to do this? What worked for you?</p>\n"
