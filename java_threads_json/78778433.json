    "body": "<p>I'm unsure why I am not receiving a result for the xpath expression in the image below. I am trying to select the <code>&lt;circle&gt;</code> tag to execute a test step in my Selenium Java test script. I have tried every identifier in the circle tag and got the same issue. If you try the my xpath expression below again with a different tag, for example <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> I receive a result.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/nWBEZJPN.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/nWBEZJPN.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>I was expecting to receive a singularly unique expression to select an item on a webpage using Java and Selenium in my automated test. I have tried multiple expression but to no success.</p>\n"
