    "title": "Problem with Specificsfion and Strategy design pattern",
    "body": "<p>I’m writing with a question I encountered in my project. I have one superclass and three subclasses, which inherit attributes from the superclass, and each subclass has its own specific attribute. I need to implement filtering with any combination of parameters (using Specifications). I’m not sure how to apply the Strategy pattern here.</p>\n<p>I tried something like having a <code>VehicleSpecification(name, power)</code> and, for example, <code>BikeSpecification(name, power, size)</code>, <code>TankSpecification(name, power, pipeLength)</code>, and maybe some interface for this, but honestly, I’m not sure. Here comes the question of the <code>BikeService</code>, where I don’t know how to structure everything so that it works with the Strategy design pattern.</p>\n"
