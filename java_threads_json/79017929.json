    "title": "Spring Jar Upgrade from 5.x to 6.x Version",
    "body": "<p>I'm upgrading my project from Spring 5.x to Spring 6.1.13 due to vulnerabilities in the older version.</p>\n<p>However, during the upgrade, I noticed that the <code>CommonsMultipartResolver</code> class from the <code>org.springframework.web.multipart.commons</code> package has been removed from the spring-web.jar.</p>\n<p>I found that the <code>StandardServletMultipartResolver</code> class can be used as an alternative. However, I'm having trouble finding a replacement for the <code>setMaxUploadSize(int)</code> and <code>setDefaultEncoding(String)</code> methods, which were available in <code>CommonsMultipartResolver</code> class, in the newer Spring 6.x version.</p>\n<p>What should I do to handle this?</p>\n"
