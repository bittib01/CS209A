    "body": "<p>I need to zip up a project I made in Intellij for a school assignment with some other files, but the project does not show up in the directory path, though Intellij can see it and it opens fine in Intellij. I've done this before so I don't know why it's an issue.</p>\n<p>Checked hidden files, moved the project to another directory, copied the project, refactored the project. Still invisible.</p>\n"
