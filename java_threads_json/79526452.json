    "title": "Reading ECB currency exchange rates from the web - unable to find valid certification",
    "body": "<p>In the past I could read the current exchange rates provided by the European Central Bank as xml data with the following code. Also when entering the\nweb address given in the code in a browser, the xml structure was nicely displayed.</p>\n<p>But the behaviour changed recently:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The code now throws a<br>\n<strong>javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException:<br>\nPKIX path building failed:<br>\nSun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException:<br>\nunable to find valid certification path to requested target</strong></li>\n<li>When entering the web address in a browser, the xml file is no more displayed,\nbut immediately and automatically downloaded in the default download folder.<br><br>\nSo I am looking for a way either</li>\n<li>to provide the requested certification to java or</li>\n<li>to programatically initiate the download, for then I could read the data from the downloaded file.<br><br>\nThere are several links in the web treating the certification, but to my understanding they are mostly tied to a specific framework or library.\nThe solution most voted for on Stackoverflow is <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21076179/pkix-path-building-failed-and-unable-to-find-valid-certification-path-to-requ?page=1&amp;tab=scoredesc#tab-top\">here</a>, but I fail already at step 1, as Firefox doesn't show the <em>lock</em> icon, when entering an address ending with xml.<br><br><br>\nP.S.:\nI barely need to access web pages in my programming tasks; that's why I never had to care for certificates so far. If this becomes a must now to understand a suggested solution, any tutorial or other learning link is welcome.</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>import java.io.*;\nimport java.net.*;\n\npublic class ReadURLTest {\n    static String webAddress;\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        if (args.length==0)\n            webAddress= &quot;https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/eurofxref/eurofxref-daily.xml&quot;;\n        else\n            webAddress= args[0];\n        try {\n            URL url = new URI(webAddress).toURL();\n            InputStream in = url.openStream();\n            byte[] b = new byte[700];\n            int l= in.readNBytes(b, 0, b.length);\n            System.out.println(l);\n            in.close();\n            String s= new String(b, 0, l);\n            System.out.println(s);\n        } catch (MalformedURLException ex) {\n            System.err.println(&quot;Bad URL string: &quot; + webAddress + &quot;\\n&quot;+ex);\n        } catch (IOException ex) {\n            System.err.println(&quot;Error reading stream: &quot; + ex);\n        } catch (URISyntaxException ex) {\n            System.err.println(&quot;Erroneous URI syntax: &quot; + ex);\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n"
