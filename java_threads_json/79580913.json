    "body": "<p>Can't Run Java in NetBeans 25 (JDK 21) – Constant run.xml Error (Line 111/68) – Need Help Before Finals!</p>\n<p>I’m having a persistent issue running even a simple Hello World Java program in Apache NetBeans 25 using JDK 21 (also tried JDK 17). Every time I try to run the project, I get this error:</p>\n<pre><code>pgsql\nCopy\nEdit\nBUILD FAILED\nC:\\\\Users\\\\markm\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\NetBeans\\\\Cache\\\\25\\\\executor-snippets\\\\run.xml:111:\nThe following error occurred while executing this line:\nC:\\\\Users\\\\markm\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\NetBeans\\\\Cache\\\\25\\\\executor-snippets\\\\run.xml:68: Java returned: 1\n</code></pre>\n<p>✅ What I’ve Already Tried\nReinstalled NetBeans and JDK multiple times</p>\n<p>Verified that JAVA_HOME is correctly set to:\n<code>C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Java\\\\jdk-21</code></p>\n<p>Added the JDK bin folder to my system Path variable</p>\n<p>In NetBeans:</p>\n<p>Tools → Java Platforms → Confirmed correct JDK is selected</p>\n<p>Right-click project → Clean and Build → Tried running again</p>\n<p>Confirmed the main class is correctly set</p>\n<p>Ran NetBeans as Administrator</p>\n<p>Deleted .netbeans, .cache, and started with fresh settings</p>\n<p>Ensured .class files exist in build/classes</p>\n<p>Checked the auto-generated run.xml file, especially around this section:</p>\n<pre><code>xml\nCopy\nEdit\n\\&lt;java classname=&quot;@{classname}&quot; dir=&quot;${work.dir}&quot; failonerror=&quot;${java.failonerror}&quot; fork=&quot;true&quot; jvm=&quot;${platform.java}&quot;\\&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>❓ What I Need Help With</p>\n<p>Is there some hidden misconfiguration (like system environment variables or NetBeans internal caches) causing this?</p>\n<p>Could NetBeans be generating run.xml incorrectly or using the wrong settings?</p>\n<p>Has anyone experienced this and found a fix?</p>\n<p>🎓 Why This Matters</p>\n<p>This issue is blocking me from starting my System Proposal, which is our Major Programming project for Finals 😭. It’s a huge part of my final grade, and I’m really eager to start building and contributing to the system now.</p>\n<p>Wish me luck and thank you in advance — any help, tip, or advice is truly appreciated! 🙏</p>\n"
