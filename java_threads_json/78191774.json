    "title": "Why my selenium java code is throwing exceptions inconsistently?",
    "body": "<p>I'm new to java and selenium, so forgive me if I missing something very obvious. So i have the following code where I'm trying to click a dropdown button and then click another button inside it.</p>\n<pre><code>public class DropDown {\n\n    private static final String URL =  &quot;https://www.browserstack.com/guide/handling-dropdown-in-selenium-without-select-class&quot;;\n    private static final String BUTTON = &quot;//*[@class='bstack-mm-nav']/div[2]/button&quot;;\n    \n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();\n        \n        driver.get(URL);\n        \n        WebElement developerButton = driver.findElement(By.xpath(BUTTON));\n        WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, Duration.ofMillis(10000));\n        \n        wait.until(ExpectedConditions.elementToBeClickable(developerButton)).click();\n        \n        WebElement buttonToClick = driver.findElement(By.xpath(&quot;//a[@title='Support']&quot;));\n        \n        buttonToClick.click();\n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I'm using an explicit wait to wait until the <code>developerButton</code> button becomes clickable. When I run this code multiple times, sometimes it runs without exceptions, and other times it throws either a <code>TimeoutException</code> or <code>ElementNotInteractableException</code>.</p>\n<p>Now my understanding is that, with the explicit wait, it should wait either till my button becomes clickable, or till the time period I have set with the wait method has been crossed, in which case it will throw a <code>TimeoutException</code>. But sometimes I'm also getting the <code>ElementNotInteractableException</code>, which in my understanding I should not be getting because the click() action on the <code>developerButton</code> should only be done after it becomes clickable. Can you please shed some light on this for me.\nNow while writing this question, I tried running that a bunch of times, and now I'm only getting a <code>TimeOutException</code>. Generally what I want to understand is the cause of this inconsistency. Thank you.</p>\n"
