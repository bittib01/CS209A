    "body": "<p>I am in the process of upgrading our project from Spring Boot version 1.3.8 to Spring Boot version 2.7.15 to address known vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>As part of the upgrade, I am using Spring Framework version 5.3.41, which is required to resolve the issues.</p>\n<p>However, while most of the dependencies are being resolved successfully from Maven Central (<a href=\"https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2</a>), I am encountering an issue with the following dependency:</p>\n<p><code>com.succsoft:spring-jcl:jar:5.3.41</code></p>\n<p>The error I am receiving during the mvn clean install process is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Could not resolve dependencies for project com.api:api-abstract-layer:war:1.0.0: Failure to find com.succsoft:spring-jcl:jar:5.3.41 in <a href=\"https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2</a> was cached in the local repository, resolution will not be reattempted until the update interval of central has elapsed or updates are forced</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Could anyone please help me resolve this issue or suggest an alternative approach to address the dependency resolution for spring-jcl?</p>\n"
