    "body": "<p>I have some data coming from an Oracle database that contains &quot;CR LF&quot;. I use a tDBInput component to read that data and feed it into a Redshift table.</p>\n<p>In the middle I have a tReplaceList that is feeded by a parameter table contain a list of forbidden character, &quot;|&quot; being one of them.</p>\n<p>The problem being the CRLF is breaking my tDBOutputBulkExec.</p>\n<p>I want to add CRLF to the list. I've tried everything like &quot;\\r&quot; &quot;\\n&quot; &quot;\\r\\n&quot;, char10 char13 etc.... But nothing has been working.</p>\n<p>After an inspection of the code of the tReplaceList component I saw that it use the Pattern.quote() method on my parameter input before using the replaceAll.</p>\n<p><code>searchPatterntReplaceList_2 = java.util.regex.Pattern.quote(searchtReplaceList_2);</code></p>\n<p>Which mean it doesn't interpret the CR LF I am trying to feed it.</p>\n<p>How can I replace this character ?</p>\n"
