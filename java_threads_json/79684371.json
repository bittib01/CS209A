    "title": "Why read barrier cannot resolve the &quot;Stop The World&quot; in the ZGC garbage collector?",
    "body": "<p>I've seen some similar posts, but I did not found a exact answer. So please remember that this question is about root marks and read barriers.</p>\n<p>For garbage collectors, such as ZGC, the Mark phase still requires concurrent marking follow-up to prevent issues like missing marking caused by modifications during traversal.</p>\n<p>Since read barriers exist, why not use them directly to capture all modifications? Even if the root is reassigned to another object, and the referenced object is disconnected from references after being copied, leading to the garbage collector failing to update its references during mutation, there's still a consideration. If the object isn't assigned to other objects during the Mark phase, it proves it has no references, so no missing marking occurs. If it is assigned to other objects, the read barrier can still capture the reference change, avoiding missing marking. So why is a &quot;Stop The World&quot; needed?</p>\n<p>Or, if this operation will take much more performance overhead or memory usage than the advantages it has?</p>\n"
