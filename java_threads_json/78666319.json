    "body": "<p>I am confused after having read different explanations of polymorphism in Java.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>The Java Programming Language book:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>polymorphism, meaning <strong>that an object of a given class can have multiple forms</strong>, either as\nits own class or as any class it extends. The new class is a subclass or extended class of the class it extends; the class that is extended is its superclass.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li><p>Sun Educational Services Java course book:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Polymorphism is the ability to have many different forms; for example, the Manager class has access to methods from Employee class.</li>\n<li><strong>An object has only one form</strong>.</li>\n<li>A reference variable can refer to objects of different forms.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>What exactly is polymorphic - the reference variable or the object?</p>\n"
