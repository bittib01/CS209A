    "body": "<p>I want to use per-request <code>ConstraintWeightOverrides</code> to allow users to customize the constraint weights. In order to not have to save a literal list of constraint names in the UI code, I want to add a REST endpoint that returns a list of all constraint names defined in the <code>ConstraintProvider</code>.</p>\n<p>I have not found a way to do this.</p>\n<p>How can I get the constraint names in a simple way? It seems like it would be a very common usage pattern.</p>\n<p>Things I have tried:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use <code>ConstraintWeightOverrides.getKnownConstraintNames</code>: this returns only the names of overridden constraints (I want the names of all constraints).</li>\n<li>Various other LLM-hallucinated solutions involving the <code>SolverFactory</code>/<code>SolverManager</code> that did not exist or work.</li>\n</ul>\n"
