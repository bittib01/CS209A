    "title": "Prevent Tomcat from reporting 404 instead of a stack trace",
    "body": "<p>Apparently, by default Tomcat will report certain errors in a servlet only on the first attempt. After that it will disable the WAR and return 404 on all subsequent attempts to access it.</p>\n<p>I’m on Tomcat 10, and I have observed this on a bunch of occasions. As far as I can tell, all of these were conditions which would prevent the servlet from even starting (outdated servlet API version, class format too new for the server and so on).</p>\n<p>That makes it a pain to debug. Is there a way to prevent Tomcat from disabling servlets on error, and return a 500 with a stack trace every time?</p>\n"
