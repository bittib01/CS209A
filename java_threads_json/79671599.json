    "body": "<p>I have Eclipse STS installed on my windows pc. I am new to using STS. I have worked with VS code earlier.</p>\n<p>In VS code, we directly open the folder containing the project and work on it. I know that we have to import it in the workspace and then work on it. But I want to know is it a thumb rule to always import the projects in the workspace while working with eclipse STS or we can also open the project folder directly like we do in vs code ?</p>\n<p>I have tried opening my project folder but it is not working.</p>\n"
