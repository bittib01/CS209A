    "body": "<p>I'm working on a large scale project(written with Java 8 and Java 11) where they have used <a href=\"https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.springfox/springfox-boot-starter/3.0.0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">springfox-boot-starter</a>.\nWe are working on migrating the project to Java 17 and Spring Boot 3, but facing the same issue mentioned in here <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71549614/springfox-type-javax-servlet-http-httpservletrequest-not-present\">Springfox Type javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest not present</a>. (Even though we can add <code>javax.servlet-api</code> to remedy this, it will not be the desired solution for this issue as it is moved to <code>jakarta.servlet-api</code>)</p>\n<p>Before moving into the <code>springdoc-openapi-starter-webmvc-ui</code> as an alternative, It would be ideal if we can confirm that SpringFox will not be a viable solution going forward.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/springfox/springfox\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">GitHub repo page</a>, <a href=\"https://springfox.github.io/springfox/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">SpringFox website</a> and the <a href=\"https://springfox.github.io/springfox/docs/current/#introduction\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Documentation</a> don't mention anything about the progress of this project.</p>\n<p>Is there any official documentation mentioning that this project is discontinued or abandoned.</p>\n"
