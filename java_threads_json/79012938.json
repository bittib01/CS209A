    "body": "<p>Good morning, we have been running the server for a few weeks now without much issues but randomly while starting tomcat it throws an error, having a hard time to solve and currently stuck not being able to run the server. This is the contents of the error:</p>\n<pre><code>20-Sep-2024 13:51:51.584 INFO [Timer-0] org.apache.catalina.loader.WebappClassLoaderBase.checkStateForResourceLoading Illegal access: this web application instance has been stopped already.

I thought it was a threading problem or improper shutting down of the server that led to some process residue still running.</p>\n"
