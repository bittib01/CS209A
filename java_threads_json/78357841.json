    "title": "Legacy vs canonical Logback configuration",
    "body": "<p>When looking through <a href=\"https://logback.qos.ch/manual/configuration.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Chapter 3</a> of the <strong>Logback manual</strong>, I've noticed that the configuration examples come in three varieties: <strong>Legacy</strong>, <strong>Canonical (1.3)</strong> and <strong>Tyler</strong>.</p>\n<p>The manual stays pretty much <em>silent</em> about these options. So I wonder now what are these, and of their purpose and use cases.</p>\n<p>I've only ever seen the <strong>Legacy</strong> option in practice and this is the one I use since it's the most succinct. The <strong>Canonical</strong> option adds a bit of boilerplate (<code>&lt;import&gt;</code>ing Java classes) and a weird <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;</code> declaration. (Note a note later on that the configuration syntax is so flexible that it's impossible to define a DTD schema for it. Why <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;</code> then?)</p>\n"
