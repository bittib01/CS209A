    "body": "<p>I have a list of ranges that consist of a start and end value. I need to optimise the list by identifying any overlapping ranges and merging them so that there is no duplication on the list.</p>\n<p>I have the following code which works</p>\n<pre><code>    private void reconcile() {\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; list.size(); i++) {\n            for (int j = 0; j &lt; i; j++) {\n                if (list.get(j).overlaps(list.get(i))) {\n                    list.get(j).merge(list.get(i));\n                    list.remove(i);\n                    i--;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>The list contains custom objects with overlap and merge methods.</p>\n<p>As I am removing objects while iterating, I need to include the <code>i--</code> to ensure I don't skip on object on the list when the indexing changes.</p>\n<p>Just wondering if there's a more elegant way of doing this?</p>\n"
