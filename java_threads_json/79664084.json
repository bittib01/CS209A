    "body": "<p>I been decided to move over from forge over to NeoForge and I am working on a mod for version 1.21.1 of Minecraft using Neoforge version 21.1.176 and Geckolib version 4.6.5</p>\n<p>I got the project to compile finaly but on loading I get this error\nCritical injection failure: Callback method geckolib$renderGeckoLibModel(...) in geckolib.mixins.json:client.HumanoidArmorLayerMixin from mod geckolib failed injection check, (0/1) succeeded. Scanned 0 target(s). No refMap loaded.</p>\n<p>Now I have been looking about and most of the search results came up empty for me what am I doing wrong, as I fallowed the setup instructions for  NeoForge and Geckolib so this crash on the client should not happen.</p>\n"
