    "body": "<p>I'm trying to create a Flutter app, but I'm getting a message about a version conflict between Java and Gradle. The output I received says</p>\n<pre><code>The configured version of Java detected may conflict with the Gradle version in your new Flutter app.\n\n[RECOMMENDED] If so, to keep the default Gradle version 8.3, make sure to download a compatible Java version\n(Java 17 &lt;= compatible Java version &lt; Java 21).\nYou may configure this compatible Java version by running:\nflutter config --jdk-dir=&lt;JDK_DIRECTORY&gt;\n...\nAlternatively, to continue using your configured Java version, update the Gradle version specified in the following file to a compatible Gradle version\n(compatible Gradle version range: 8.4 - 8.7):\n</code></pre>\n<p>I am not sure how to fix this. Should I change the Java version or update Gradle? What is the best way to solve this issue to make my Flutter app run without errors?</p>\n"
