    "body": "<p>I want to do some integration testing + setup local dev environment for a Java/Spring Boot application that interacts with Kubernetes via Argo Workflows.  I don't see a Kubernetes test container (probably because K8s is not just one container) but I did notice the K3 container which is supposedly a lightweight distro for kubernetes.</p>\n<p>I usually use a locally installed Minikube instance to achieve this but Testcontainers are very cool and I'm already using them for my DB and a Kafka queue, would be nice to have one solution for everything.</p>\n<p>Is there a way to use Testcontainers to test an app that interacts with Kubernetes via Argo Wofkflows?</p>\n"
