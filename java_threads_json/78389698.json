    "title": "dynamic programming min path grid sum",
    "body": "<p>I recently found a frustrating error in my code. I have two solutions for finding the minimum path sum using dynamic programming (DP). The first solution, which I wrote, doesn't seem to work, even though the logic seems perfect. Here's my code:</p>\n<pre><code>class Solution {\n    public int minPathSum(int[][] arr) {\n        return f(arr.length-1, arr[0].length-1, arr);\n    }\n\n    public int f(int i, int j, int[][] arr) {\n        if (i &lt; 0 || j &lt; 0) return Integer.MAX_VALUE;\n        if (i == 0 &amp;&amp; j == 0) return arr[0][0];\n        int up = arr[i][j] + f(i-1, j, arr);\n        int left = arr[i][j] + f(i, j-1, arr);\n        return Math.min(up, left);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>However, I found another solution online that works:</p>\n<pre><code>class Solution {\n    public int minPathSum(int[][] grid) {\n        int m = grid.length-1;\n        int n = grid[0].length-1;\n        return find(grid, m, n);\n    }\n\n    public int find(int grid[][], int m, int n) {\n        if (m &lt; 0 || n &lt; 0) return Integer.MAX_VALUE;\n        if (m == 0 &amp;&amp; n == 0) return grid[0][0];\n        return grid[m][n] + Math.min(find(grid, m-1, n), find(grid, m, n-1));\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The only difference between my solution and the working solution is how we return the result. In my solution, I used <code>up</code> and <code>left</code> to store the result of recursive calls with the current path value, and later chose the minimum path. However, in the working solution, it's all done in a single step. What's the difference between these two? Please clarify my doubt.</p>\n"
