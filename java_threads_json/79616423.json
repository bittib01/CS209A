    "title": "Split the large facet in the geojson file into multiple small facets",
    "body": "<p>I have a geojson file that needs to iterate over all the polygons in all the features, but some of them are very large, making it slow to perform certain tasks, and I would like to split them into smaller polygons and then use multiple threads to perform the tasks and finally merge the results.</p>\n<p>My initial idea was to run the points of the boundary and then split them evenly so that the first and last points of the boundary are connected. This works well for regular shapes like circles, but for irregular polygons, it changes the original shape.</p>\n<p>I'm using Java, is there a Java library? Other languages are fine, such as Python.</p>\n<p>Looking forward to your help!</p>\n"
