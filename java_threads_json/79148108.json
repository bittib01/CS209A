    "title": "Application Insights shows failures as if they are in the library and not in my application",
    "body": "<p>I have integrated Application Insights into my Spring Boot application. When there are exceptions it lists location of the exceptions as if they are occurring in the library level. But I cannot fix those libraries. Would be useful if it lists location of the exceptions in my application.</p>\n<p>In other words now it shows the exception occurs <code>at org.springframework.web.reactive.function.client.ExchangeFunctions:111</code> but it is very useless for me. Is it possible to make it so that it show location in my own app like <code>at com.example.test.MyOwnService:123</code>?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/fipV4m6t.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/fipV4m6t.png\" alt=\"Exceptions in Application Insights\" /></a></p>\n"
