    "title": "OracleConnectionBuilderImpl is not compatible with java.sql.ConnectionBuilder",
    "body": "<p>I asked this question before but really didn't get too far with any results. I stopped for a bit and have returned to attempt to get this to work. I'm upgrading from Java 8 to Java 11 on our repository and when attempting to run mvn install I get this error:</p>\n<pre><code>[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-compiler-plugin:3.8.1:compile (default-compile) on project &lt;project&gt;: Compilation failure\n[ERROR] &lt;project&gt;.java:[15,8] createConnectionBuilder() in oracle.jdbc.datasource.impl.OracleDataSource cannot implement createConnectionBuilder() in javax.sql.DataSource\n[ERROR]   return type oracle.jdbc.datasource.impl.OracleConnectionBuilderImpl is not compatible with java.sql.ConnectionBuilder\n</code></pre>\n<p>I've searched all over for anything about what this might be and the only real thing I got was that ojdbc8 might be the wrong version. I updated our pom.xml to the most recent version of OJDBC8 (19.3.0.0 -&gt; 23.3.0.23.09):</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;dependency&gt;\n  &lt;groupId&gt;com.oracle.database.jdbc&lt;/groupId&gt;\n  &lt;artifactId&gt;ojdbc8&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n  &lt;version&gt;23.3.0.23.09&lt;/version&gt;\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here is the class the error is referencing, I'm unable to see anywhere where there might be an issue as there wasn't one on Java 8 and the code itself seems fine:</p>\n<pre><code>import oracle.jdbc.pool.OracleDataSource;\nimport org.springframework.security.crypto.encrypt.Encryptors;\n\nimport java.sql.SQLException;\nimport java.sql.SQLFeatureNotSupportedException;\nimport java.util.logging.Logger;\n\n\npublic class MtDataSource extends OracleDataSource {\n\n    public MtDataSource() throws SQLException {\n        super();\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I don't find any link between the oracleDataSource and anything with CreateConnectionBuilder that would be tied back to this class from javax.sql.DataSource or java.sql.ConnectionBuilder.</p>\n<p>Looking for any advice as I'm completely lost as to what is causing the compile issue. Thanks!</p>\n<p>I've attempted trying different versions of OJDBC8 in the pom.xml, have tried different versions of maven-compiler-plugin, have tried cleaning before install.</p>\n"
