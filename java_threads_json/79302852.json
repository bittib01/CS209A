    "title": "How to Implement a Garbage-Free Object Pool in Java?",
    "body": "<p>My Java application has excessive garbage collection due to frequent object creation and disposal, so I want to implement an object pool to reuse objects and reduce GC overhead. How can I design a garbage-free object pool that dynamically adjusts its size (without creating garbage) based on application load? Can you provide an example implementation or guidance for pooling strategies, especially for handling pool growth?</p>\n"
