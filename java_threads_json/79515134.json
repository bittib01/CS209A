    "title": "Issue with Reading JSON File from Resources Folder in Spring Boot after Migrating to Java 17",
    "body": "<p>I recently migrated my project to Java 17 and Spring Boot 2.5.7. After the migration, I'm encountering an issue where a JSON file located in my resources folder isn't being read correctly when running on Tomcat (WAR file deployment) in the testing environment. The same code works fine locally.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>File Path:</p>\n<p>pubs/src/main/resources/db.mongo.query/FORM16.json</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Code:</p>\n<pre><code>String query = new String(\n    Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get(new ClassPathResource(&quot;db.mongo.query/&quot; + this.name + &quot;.json&quot;).getURI()))\n);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Problem:</p>\n<p>The file is located in the resources folder, but when the application is deployed on Tomcat (testing environment), I get an error when attempting to read the file.\nThe code works correctly when running the application locally.\nI have confirmed that the Tomcat user has read permissions for the file. I have checked for a different file and it works as expected</p>\n<p>Has anyone encountered this issue after migrating to Java 17 and Spring Boot 2.5.7? Any suggestions on how to resolve this?</p>\n"
