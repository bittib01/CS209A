    "body": "<p>I'm trying to add the WebRTC library to my Android project, but I'm encountering an issue with resolving the dependency. Here's the relevant part of my build.gradle.kts file:</p>\n<pre><code>dependencies {\n    implementation(&quot;org.webrtc:google-webrtc:1.0.32006&quot;)\n}\n\nrepositories {\n    google()\n    mavenCentral()\n    jcenter()\n    maven { url = uri(&quot;https://jitpack.io&quot;) }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I tried the methods of a question that was asked previously on Stack Overflow, but it is not fixing.</p>\n<p>I was expecting that this dependency would install</p>\n"
