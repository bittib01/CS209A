    "body": "<p>I'm practicing with conexions between java and databases for a future project but i came to a &quot;dead&quot; end.</p>\n<p>My problems is that i have (System A: 192.168.1.6) and (System B: 192.168.1.254) System B is a windows 10 virtual machine hosted in VirtualBox (Net card is set as bridge)</p>\n<p>Anyways, im trying to connect to a database hosted in System B with XAMPP but i can't make it to work in any way from System A, this is the current line im trying to connect with:</p>\n<p><code>Connection connect = DriverManager.getConnection(&quot;jdbc:mysql://192.168.1.254:3306/caleno&quot;, &quot;root&quot;, &quot;&quot;);</code></p>\n<p>If I try to run my program on System A it won't work, but if i change the IP for localhost and move it to System B it will run normally, for this practice it doesn't really matters where do I run it but I'd like to know how to interconnect both computers, I will also share a github link at the end where I have the current state of my project in case someone wants to try it.</p>\n<p>I tried creating new users on xamp with global access, following the stated previously on link 1 and changing XAMP configuration as stated on link 2</p>\n<p>I also tried the following lines of code (just for the sake of trying)\n<code>Connection connect = DriverManager.getConnection(&quot;jdbc:mysql://192.168.1.254:3306/caleno&quot;, &quot;root&quot;, &quot;&quot;);</code>\n<code>Connection connect = DriverManager.getConnection(&quot;jdbc:mysql://192.168.1.254:8080/caleno&quot;, &quot;root&quot;, &quot;&quot;);</code> (this one is after doing the stuff related on link 2, with this one the program freezes and eventually later gives an error)\n<code>Connection connect = DriverManager.getConnection(&quot;jdbc:mysql://192.168.1.254/caleno&quot;, &quot;root&quot;, &quot;&quot;);</code>(i knew this one wouldnt work but worth a shot anyways)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15861796/how-to-connect-to-a-database-running-on-vm\">Link 1</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9682262/how-do-i-connect-to-this-localhost-from-another-computer-on-the-same-network\">Link 2</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/BulkyBell/caleno\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Github Repository</a></p>\n<p>Additionally, inside of /com/caleno/resources there is a folder named sql, where there is a copy of my databse (tho it only has 1 table and 1 registry inside of it)</p>\n<p>Info related to my database connection is on java/com/caleno (database file) then on FXMLDocumentController is where I use this connection in order to continue</p>\n<p>Please, understand that I´m just a student and I´m pretty new to this world so if possible I would appreciate if you could explain what I´m doing wrong, thanks a lot in advance</p>\n"
