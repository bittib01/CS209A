    "title": "The type org.bouncycastle.cms.cmsutils is not visible",
    "body": "<p>I want to subclass some BC classes, in my Java project, but I faced issue with import of CMSUtils class. In order to reproduce issue in a simple project, I created quick-start Maven project (Eclipse 2024-06 IDE). Here are some details:</p>\n<p>in pom.xml:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;dependency&gt;\n   &lt;groupId&gt;org.bouncycastle&lt;/groupId&gt;\n   &lt;artifactId&gt;bcpkix-jdk18on&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n   &lt;version&gt;1.78.1&lt;/version&gt;\n &lt;/dependency&gt;\n\n &lt;dependency&gt;\n   &lt;groupId&gt;org.bouncycastle&lt;/groupId&gt;\n   &lt;artifactId&gt;bcprov-jdk18on&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n   &lt;version&gt;1.78.1&lt;/version&gt;\n &lt;/dependency&gt;\n\n &lt;dependency&gt;\n   &lt;groupId&gt;org.bouncycastle&lt;/groupId&gt;\n   &lt;artifactId&gt;bcutil-jdk18on&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n   &lt;version&gt;1.78.1&lt;/version&gt;\n &lt;/dependency&gt;\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>In .java file:</p>\n<pre><code>package cmstest;\n\nimport org.bouncycastle.cms.CMSTypedStream;\nimport org.bouncycastle.cms.CMSUtils;\n\npublic class App {\n    public static void main( String\\[\\] args ) {\n        System.out.println( &quot;Hello World!&quot; );\n    }\n}\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>So, on CMSUtils import, IDE reports: &quot;<em>The type org.bouncycastle.cms.CMSUtils is not visible</em>&quot;. On the other hand, it does not complain on other import, which is here only to show that other class from same .jar is visible.</p>\n<p>I looked at content of bcpkix-jdk18on-1.78.1.jar file, and can see both classes. Therefore, it is strange that import of CMSUtils is not possible.</p>\n<p>Any idea what's wrong here?</p>\n<p>EDITED, 05.09.2024.\nWorking on some project that is using BC classes, I found that I need customized way of digital signing, that does not include private key from some file, but private key on smartcard. In order to customize BC classes, I tried with subclassing some of BC classes, but under my package (for example com.name.package). Soon, I discovered issue with visibility of CMSUtils class, as I described before.</p>\n"
