    "title": "How to create separate extent report for different runner class(java) in cucumber + Testng",
    "body": "<p>I have the following use case.</p>\n<p>I  have a cucumber framework with java &amp; testng. I am generating  extent report (com.cucumber.listener.ExtentCucumberFormatter in runner file). I have 600 scenarios and each scenario will have 3 snapshots (in .png format) to be attached in the report (total 1800 .png files). I have a &quot;screenshot&quot; folder under target which have all the snapshots saved. The .html extent report along with this screenshots folder is around 300 MB after zipping. Therefore I am unable to upload this to JIRA.</p>\n<p>I thought to mark these testcases on different tags and create different runner files based on exclusive tags. I tried to separate different  reports for individual runner</p>\n<p>like Runner1.java:</p>\n<pre><code>@CucumberOptions( plugin = { &quot;com.cucumber.listener.ExtentCucumberFormatter:target/cucumber-reports/report1.html&quot;})\n</code></pre>\n<p>Runner1.java:</p>\n<pre><code>@CucumberOptions( plugin = { &quot;com.cucumber.listener.ExtentCucumberFormatter:target/cucumber-reports/report2.html&quot;})\n</code></pre>\n<p>I am putting these two java classes in testng.xml. I though if I run testng, it will invoke these two runners one by one and separate report1 &amp; report2 templates will be generated. However I found  all the testcases saved in report1.html only which is of course 300 MB. So back to square one</p>\n<p>Could you please suggest some solution here. So that I can have two different reports altogether</p>\n"
