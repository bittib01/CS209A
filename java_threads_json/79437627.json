    "title": "find minimum cost to get unique items",
    "body": "<p>Here is the task:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Given an array of numbers called nums of size n and another array\ncalled cost of size n</p>\n<p>cost[i] where i is index represents the cost to increment an element\nnums[i]</p>\n<p>Calculate the minimum cost to make all items in nums distinct.</p>\n<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>\n<pre><code>nums = [3,7,9,7,8]\ncost = [5,2,5,7,5]\n\nanswer = 6\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<p>In nums element 7 is repeated twice with cost as [2,7]</p>\n<p>we can pick the number 7 with cost 2, and increment it 3 times so it\nchanges to 7 -&gt; 8 -&gt; 9 -&gt; 10. so incremented 3 times, so cost is 2 * 3\n= 6</p>\n<p>Calculate the minimum cost to make the nums array distinct</p>\n<p><strong>constraints :</strong></p>\n<pre><code>1 &lt;= n &lt;= 10^5\n1 &lt;= nums[i] &lt;= 10^9\n1 &lt;= cost[i] &lt;= 10^4\n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My approach to solve this was to pick initial unique items and store in a HashSet in Java</p>\n<p>Next get the duplicate items in nums in sorted order, and calculate the least cost for each element, then increment item till it becomes unique and calculate cost for that element.</p>\n<p>Similarly get the sum of costs to increment all duplicates till the become unique in nums</p>\n<p>But my approach is not correct because it is not always true that we can process from smallest to largest item and get the answer</p>\n<p>I am looking for the correct approach to solve this problem in less time complexity.</p>\n"
