    "title": "New Relic APM agent VS New Relic OpenTelemetry for Quarkus microservices monitoring and observability",
    "body": "<p>I have a Quarkus application (consuming/producing messages from multiple Kafka topics) deployed on an AWS Kubernetes cluster. I want to monitor/observe my application. Right now, I am using the Quarkus OpenTelemtry library to send metrics to New Relic which is very straightforward (provide distributed tracing as well with Kafka events out of the box), but it doesn't contain JVM metrics and I can't create SLO for New Relic OpenTelemetry service, there are other features which are not available for OpenTelemetry but available with the Java agent.</p>\n<p>Is there a way to get JVM metrics with OpenTelemetry? If not then will it be a good idea to move to java agent?</p>\n<p>Please suggest which one should we go with, New Relic OpenTelemtry or New Relic Java agent.</p>\n"
