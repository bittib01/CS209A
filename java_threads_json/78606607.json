    "title": "Postgres pg_background asynchronous queries",
    "body": "<p>I am trying to perform <code>DELETE</code> and <code>INSERT</code> statements in a trigger function, like</p>\n<pre><code>BEGIN\n  IF (TG_OP = 'DELETE') THEN\n    DELETE FROM…;\n    INSERT INTO…;\n    RETURN OLD;\n  ELSIF (TG_OP = 'UPDATE' OR TG_OP = 'INSERT') THEN\n    DELETE FROM…;\n    INSERT INTO…;\n    RETURN NEW;\n  END IF;\n  RETURN NULL; -- result is ignored since this is an AFTER trigger\nEND;\n</code></pre>\n<p>but as trigger execution is synchronous, the performance of each statement will be bad, so I need to have the statements in the trigger function to be performed asynchronously. I had found some approaches like dblink and pg_background. In dblink, PostgreSQL creates a new connection, which also does not suit for my use case, and it also takes long, so I dropped it.</p>\n<p>I tried pg_background to achieve asynchronous execution like</p>\n<pre><code>DECLARE\n    result text;\nBEGIN\n    IF (TG_OP = 'DELETE') THEN\n        SELECT * FROM pg_background_result(pg_background_launch(sql_command)) AS (result TEXT) INTO  result;\n        SELECT * FROM pg_background_result(pg_background_launch(sql_command)) as (result TEXT) INTO result;\n        RETURN OLD;\n    ELSIF (TG_OP = 'UPDATE' OR TG_OP = 'INSERT') THEN\n        SELECT * FROM pg_background_result(pg_background_launch(sql_command)) as (result TEXT) INTO     result;\n        SELECT * FROM pg_background_result(pg_background_launch(sql_command)) as (result TEXT) INTO result;\n        RETURN NEW;\n    END IF;\n    RETURN NULL; -- result is ignored since this is an AFTER trigger\nEND;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here we are also facing performance issues.  PostgreSQL consumes more time than with direct synchronous statements.</p>\n<p>Is this approach correct for my use case? How can I achieve it using some other approach?</p>\n<p>I had tried with <code>LISTEN</code> and <code>NOTIFY</code> using <code>pg_notify()</code>, but I can’t listen and perform additional statements inside Postgres itself, so I have written a Java application to listen for this notification and perform the statements asynchronously. That is working fine, but I need to reduce the external dependencies here.</p>\n"
