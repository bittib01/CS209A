    "title": "Does exist any way to test a subclass that extends another class isolated from parent class?",
    "body": "<p>I am working on java. I have this class <code>ConfigServer</code> that extends the class <code>GeneralServer</code>, to clarify I mean: <code>public class ConfigServer extends GeneralServer</code>. What I want to do is to create an instance of <code>ConfigServer</code> but isolated from the superclass functionality. Is possible programmatically to make something like this in a way that the solution wouldn't affect the current architecture and inheritance?</p>\n<p>I need to make this isolation because if I use the actual <code>GeneralServer</code> class then I need to configure the whole environment that will hosts a database which will communicate with the <code>GeneralServer</code> but I need to avoid this time consuming process. So as I can think the only manner that I could be something like this, is to create a new class for example <code>ConfigServerTestImpl</code> but I think that is not the appropriate way to implement integration test for between two classes.</p>\n"
