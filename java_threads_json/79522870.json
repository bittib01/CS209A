    "body": "<p>We are building a Docker image for a Java + Maven project that runs a Spring Boot application using Kafka.</p>\n<p>When we build the image on Windows and run the container on a Linux server, everything works fine.\nHowever, when we build the image on Linux and run it on the same Linux server, it fails with the following error:</p>\n<p>Error creating bean with name 'someName' defined in URL [jar:nested:/app/target/kafka.jar/!BOOT-INF/classes/!/aggregations/processors/someName.class]:\nUnsatisfied dependency expressed through constructor parameter 0:\nError creating bean with name 'someName2' defined in class path [org/springframework/kafka/annotations/someName2.class]:\nFailed to instantiate [org.springframework.kafka.config.someName2]:\nFactory method 'defaultKafkaStreamsBuilder' threw exception with message: null</p>\n<p>We made sure that:</p>\n<p>We are using the same version of Docker on both Windows and Linux.\nOur Maven build process produces the correct .jar file in both environments.\nWe are working in a closed network, so we cannot share code.</p>\n<p>What could be causing this issue, and how can we debug it further?</p>\n"
