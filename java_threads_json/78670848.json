    "title": "Java files are displayed as orange icons by IntelliJ and can&#39;t be opened",
    "body": "<p>I am using IntelliJ IDEA 2024.1.1 (Community Edition).</p>\n<p>All my Java files are showing as Orange Icons (with a coffee cup) in the project file browser on the left hand side. I click on the file name and nothing happens.  If I then right click on the file and click on &quot;Reload from Disk&quot;, then the filename turns white, and I can then click on the file and it opens for editing in the main window.</p>\n<p>However, if I shut down the IDE or click on the menu item: &quot;File -&gt; Reload all from disk&quot;, then the files turn orange again and can't be opened.  I have tried invalidating the cache and restarting - but it does not work.</p>\n<p>I have noticed on startup that the files are fleetingly white for a while before they turn orange.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/p8UxIyfg.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/p8UxIyfg.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n"
