    "title": "Should virtual thread die fast?",
    "body": "<p>It' s recommended by JDK developers that virtual threads should never be pooled, because they  are really cheap to create and destroy. I am a little confusing about the pooling idea, since pooling usually means two things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The resources should be reused</li>\n<li>The resources will have a long lifecycle until it's released</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I understand that JDK developers want us to never reuse a virtual thread, and the lifecycle question confuses me, because if there are multiple virtual thread having lifecycle as long as the application itself, it might sounds like pooling without reuse.</p>\n<p>So should a virtual thread die fast, or having a short bounded lifecycle, or is it OK that multiple virtual threads were blocking, once in a while waken up to process some tasks, and having a really long lifecycle?</p>\n"
