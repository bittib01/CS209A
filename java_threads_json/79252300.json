    "title": "Getting rid of Eclipse Junit 4 runtime configuration extraneous VM arguments",
    "body": "<p>I'm fighting with Eclipse version 2024-09 right now when running junit tests.  When I go to run our Junit 4 (yes old) tests, it complains with very opaque error message:</p>\n<pre><code>Reference to undefined variable argLine\n</code></pre>\n<p>After poking around for a while I find that under the Run Configurations for the Junit test in question, in the VM arguments window there is not only <code>-ea</code> but also a whole bunch of additional arguments include <code>${argLine}</code>.  Ok, good.  But I have no idea where that is coming from.  When I delete that configuration and re-run, the extra arguments come back.</p>\n<p>The full argument list follows.  You can see that there are some obvious debug flags in there that I might set if doing some profiling or remove debugging.  But again, where are they coming from?</p>\n<pre><code>-ea\n${argLine} -javaagent:${com.github.jbellis:jamm:jar}\n-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n\n-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true -Xms512m -Xmx1g -DMHUB_DEV=true \n</code></pre>\n<p>I did some searches and found people talking about the Installed JREs -&gt; Edit -&gt; Default VM arguments but none of my JREs have any arguments.</p>\n<p>I've done a <code>grep -r</code> of &quot;argLine&quot; and &quot;agentlib&quot; down in my workspace configurations and maven pom.xml file to see if it was in some sort of plugin configurations or something.  I see it show up in the test run configurations but nowhere else.  I don't see it in the environment nor in any maven pom plugin configurations that I can find.  I've tried restarting Eclipse.</p>\n<p>Any other ideas?  Thanks in advance.</p>\n"
