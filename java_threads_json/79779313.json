    "body": "<p>I am using global redis datastore, with two clusters Region-A and Region-B.\nEach regional cluster has three redis nodes one primary and two read replicas.</p>\n<p>I have my service deployed in two regions as well Region-A and Region-B. So essentially I'm in an active/active setup when both Regions receive traffic.</p>\n<p>Region-A and Region-B consume messages that get replicated between regions, which means that I'm getting duplicates.</p>\n<p>Services need to be idempotent, so I'm using redis as a distributed lock mechanism.</p>\n<p>The quesion:\nJava redison lib provides two APIs to lock something in redis:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>getLock -&gt; tryLock</li>\n<li>getBucket -&gt; setIfAbsent</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Performance of those two is drastically different: <em>80ms</em> for fist option and <em>5ms</em> for the second option. Documentation is saying that option 2 is discouraged.</p>\n<p>What's the difference? Is it safe to use option 2 for my use case?</p>\n"
