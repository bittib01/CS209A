    "title": "Build jvm without jdk",
    "body": "<p>I need to build OpenJDK on Linux x64.\nThe main idea is not to use any precompiled BootJDK and build the jdk itself. Precompiled means compiled by someone else (Build by OpenJdk for example <a href=\"https://jdk.java.net/archive/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://jdk.java.net/archive/</a>). I need it to build an rpm package into one distribution what based on RHEL. I give link on Fedora Packaging Guidelines, what explain why I don't want to use precompiled archive (<a href=\"https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/what-can-be-packaged/#prebuilt-binaries-or-libraries\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/what-can-be-packaged/#prebuilt-binaries-or-libraries</a>). This documentation says that there may be exceptions where it is impossible to build something without external binaries (something like gcc or other compilators). Taking these exceptions into account, other necessary utilities are already in the repositories (make, gcc etc), only the jdk itself is missing.</p>\n<p>I just wanted to know possibility to overcome this exception when building the jdk.</p>\n<p>So my question: is it possible to somehow build jvm from sources, and then build the rest of jdk based on this build?</p>\n<p>Maybe I'm wrong, but looks like jvm is written in C and C++ (сorrect me if I'm wrong). In that case nothing should prevent from compiling it without jdk itself, for example using &quot;gcc&quot;.</p>\n<p>&quot;make&quot; accepts target hotspot, but configure script still checks for BootJDK and does not allow to proceed further.\nSo I'm stuck here</p>\n"
