    "body": "<p>i reinstalled the whole windows system because of a trojan that i had.\nI installed java JDK 21, as i need it to code minecraft plugins.</p>\n<p>I installed the plugin MinecraftDevelopment as usual, done everything the same way i'd do it before reinstalling windows, but when i create a new project the run button is grayed out, and if i hover on it it says &quot;the file in the editor is not runnable&quot;.\nEven by opening a project that i used to work on before resetting, the error i get is the same. What am i missing?</p>\n<p>I tried setting the folder src as root, invalidating cache, repairing IDE, making new project, reinstalling intellij, importing spigot manually,. but nothing seems to be working.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/GsI1wFVQ.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/GsI1wFVQ.png\" alt=\"IntelliJ screenshot\" /></a></p>\n"
