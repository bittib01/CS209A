    "body": "<p>I'm using GraalVM and trying to make exe file from jar file, but it said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Error: Failed to find 'vcvarsall.bat' in a Visual Studio installation.\nPlease make sure that Visual Studio 2022 version 17.1.0 or later is installed on your system. You can download it at <a href=\"https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/</a>. If this error persists, please try and run GraalVM Native Image in an x64 Native Tools Command Prompt or file a ticket.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In GraalVM docs, it said that I have to install MSVC, Windows 10 SDK, CMake, Testing tool,... I installed all of them except my SDK is Windows 11 SDK but I think it should have been compatible with Windows 10 SDK.</p>\n<p>Does anyone know how to fix it?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/W0fUl.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">My Visual Studio Installer</a></p>\n"
