    "title": "Unable to Select Images from Gallery on Android 11 Using Java",
    "body": "<p>I'm trying to select an image from the gallery, but I can't get the file, I don't know why this is happening. Of course, I used the library I wrote, but it doesn't work for Android 11 and above. That's why I wrote again to access the gallery, which does not select. My goal is to access the camera and gallery that receives image files to work on Android 11 up and down.</p>\n<p>my code:\n<a href=\"https://github.com/oktayAmin/Imageutils/blob/main/imageUtils.java\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://github.com/oktayAmin/Imageutils/blob/main/imageUtils.java</a></p>\n"
