    "body": "<p>When I turn on the Accessibility Service, what I expected is the method “SVR.onAccessibilityConnected” would immediately invoke and then the app would play music loudly and show a window cover the whole screen to prevent user to kill the app aiming to make people embrassed.\nBut when I auctually install and run the app and turn on the accessibility service, nothing happens.In the file &quot;/sdcard/Android/data/com.example.lyt/files/1 log.txt&quot;, I don't see &quot;onServiceConnected&quot; printed.After I kill the app and run it again, the window showed and the music start to play.\nThat's weird.
