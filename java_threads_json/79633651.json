    "body": "<p>I'm using a Spring Boot application that connects to two MariaDB databases. When I run the app, I notice that there are about 10 connections per database shown in the SHOW PROCESSLIST; output — all in Sleep state\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/oxVzZpA4.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/oxVzZpA4.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>I suspect this is related to the connection pooling mechanism (possibly HikariCP), but I have a few concerns:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is this normal behavior for Spring Boot with connection pooling?\n-Can having 20+ sleeping connections cause any issues like resource exhaustion or deadlocks?</li>\n<li>Will it cause problems under load or degrade performance over time?</li>\n<li>How can I configure or reduce the number of idle connections if needed?\nHere is a snippet of my application.properties:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Any insights or best practices for managing these idle connections or connection pool sizes would be appreciated.</p>\n"
