    "title": "Stopping message flow in the middle of a Spring integration flow",
    "body": "<p>I have a spring integration flow which listens to JMS messages using the Java DSL through the use of a JMS messageDrivenChannelAdapter. It has a subflow as follows:</p>\n<pre><code>f -&gt; f.handle(ServiceA)\n      .handle(ServiceB);\n</code></pre>\n<p>In Service A, I am writing a message to a DB. If I receive a transient error, I simply throw this error which causes the message to get redelivered as expected.</p>\n<p>However if I receive a non-transient exception in ServiceA, I want to stop processing the message in this flow (I do not want it to be sent further down the integration flow to ServiceB, or other downstream endpoints) and I want to acknowledge the jms message so that it is removed from the queue.\nHow can I do this?</p>\n"
