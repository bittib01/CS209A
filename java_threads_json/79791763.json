    "body": "<p>I have to repaint the screen every refresh, and matching with the native refresh rate makes smooth animations. It seems the easiest way to get the native refresh rate is via:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>Component.getGraphicsConfiguration().getDevice().getDisplayMode().getRefreshRate()\n</code></pre>\n<p>but calling this every frame would tank the framerate of my application to 4. How do I detect if the native refresh rate were to change without doing that?</p>\n"
