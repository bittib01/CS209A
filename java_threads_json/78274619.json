    "title": "Fixing error &quot;Lombok annotation handler class lombok.eclipse.handlers.HandleBuilder failed&quot;",
    "body": "<p>In my Windowns 11 environment I use Visual Studio Code (1.87.2) to develop Java applications. In one of these apps we use some of the Project Lombok's annotations (1.18.24) such as @Builder, @Data, @EqualsAndHashCode and so on.</p>\n<p>After opening the project using Eclipse For Java Developers (2024-03 R) and going back to VSCode every class that uses the annotations showed errors on VSCode and the project doesn't compile anymore. Apparently the error that traces back to the rest is the one in the title as I found another user with the same problems in this issue: <a href=\"https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-java/issues/3561\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-java/issues/3561</a>.</p>\n<p>The error persisted even after I tried updating to the latest Lombok release (1.18.32), removing the Eclipse installation, using a previous version, deleting all info from my SO user and reconfiguring the environment (JDK + Maven).</p>\n<p>I need help to understand the problem to see if it's fixable and how should I go on if possible or if the case is a matter of waiting until a fix is added.</p>\n"
