    "title": "Exchange a file in a ZIP file quickly",
    "body": "<p>In a Java program, I need to exchange files in a large ZIP file quickly.</p>\n<p>So if <em>a.txt</em> is a file inside <em>b.zip</em> I want to replace the <em>a.txt</em> with a new version of <em>a.txt</em> inside <em>b.zip</em>. It should happen in a second or less.</p>\n<p>I wonder if the following would be possible:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Remove the entry of <em>a.txt</em> from the file table.</li>\n<li>Add a new version of <em>a.txt</em> at the end of the existing ZIP file.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This would leave some &quot;garbage&quot; lying around (as in the contents of the old <em>a.txt</em> file, which does not really matter), but one would not need to copy the whole ZIP file.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, if you cannot just remove the file, one could move it to some directory like <em>garbage/a.txt</em>, which is then ignored by the program reading the ZIP file.</p>\n<p>Can this be done (within Java)?</p>\n"
