    "body": "<p>I'm trying to get the <code>search_condition</code> from <code>check_ddls</code> with read-only access in Oracle, and need to group these rows with a <code>;</code> delimiter.</p>\n<p>I've tried using <code>LIST_AGG</code>, but it seems that Oracle doesn’t support aggregation for <code>LONG</code> data types, and there is no easy way to convert a <code>LONG</code> to a string. However, if I could, somehow, group these bytes, and then convert them to a string using Java, that would be a great solution. But I haven’t found a suitable approach yet.</p>\n<p>I was trying to convert <code>LONG</code> many times.</p>\n"
