    "title": "Lombok errors - can not find symbol, variable xyz not initialized in the default constructor, etc in Idea",
    "body": "<p>I was facing this issue in my recent project where I was getting errors like these:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><code>java: variable resourceService not initialized in the default constructor</code></strong></li>\n<li><strong><code>java: cannot find symbol</code><br />\n<code>symbol:   method getId()</code><br />\n<code>location: class com.demo.entity.Resource</code></strong></li>\n<li>Also there was another strange one that I couldn't recall what exactly it was.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From the errors I was certain that the mistakes revolved around Lombok-generated code, So I tried finding the root cause and for that reviewed some forums/threads, asked AI agents also tried everything from checking Lombok <code>plugin</code>, <code>dependency</code>, <code>annotation processing enabled</code>, etc to <code>changing the versions</code> of Lombok and all but wasn't able to find the cause and the most confusing thing was that I was able to get all those methods like getters, setters in IDE suggestion but at the time of compiling I was getting errors then I again read some of the threads and was playing with settings a little bit during that I found out the solution.</p>\n<p>Now I know you must be thinking that if I already have the solution for this issue then What the heck I am doing here by asking the question? So the thing is that I just wanted to post it anyway because I could not find the solution on the internet although I got the idea where the problem might be from some of the forums and will specify some of the steps that might work for you if you are facing the same issue.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> I was wrong there is the same solution available on Stackoverflow for the issue which I figured out and guess what I found it out while I was collecting links to reference here. I feel so stupid but still, now that I wrote this much I will post this anyway, So bear with me, please. Here is the solution: <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9424364/cant-compile-project-when-im-using-lombok-under-intellij-idea\">Can&#39;t compile project when I&#39;m using Lombok under IntelliJ IDEA</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I know many people facing these errors are aware of these simple solutions but still, I am enlisting it for newcomers, so double-check for the following things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You have added Lombok as dependency in your <strong><code>pom.xml</code></strong>(Maven Build) or <strong><code>build.gradle</code></strong>(Gradle Build)</li>\n<li>You have enabled annotation processing in Idea(IDE) from <code>Settings</code> -&gt; <code>Build, Execution, Deployment</code> -&gt; <code>Compiler</code> -&gt; <code>Annotation Processors</code> -&gt; <code>Enable annotation processing</code> - should be checked.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Settings can vary in future updates of IDE, The settings mentioned here are based on <strong><code>Idea 2024.3.2 release</code></strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Someone also mentioned changing the compiler to javac if that's not the default one</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now this is what worked for me so when I was playing with settings in <code>Settings</code> -&gt; <code>Build, Execution, Deployment</code> -&gt; <code>Compiler</code> -&gt; <code>Annotation Processors</code> -&gt; <code>Enable annotation processing</code> I was going through processor path settings and found out that my processor path for annotation processor was obtained from project classpath for default profile which was perfectly fine and it should be that way unless and until you have installed Lombok elsewhere and using that for the project then you have to specify the path for the .jar file of Lombok putting that aside what I discovered just below my default profile there was current projects profile which was taking a custom processor path which was random path assigned to it by Idea or something else and it was the root cause of these all issues.</p>\n"
