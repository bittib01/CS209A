    "body": "<p>I'm learning LoD, and I read below block from <a href=\"https://www.baeldung.com/java-demeter-law\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Simply put, the Law says that a method X of class C should only invoke the methods of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Class C itself</li>\n<li>An object created by X</li>\n<li>An object passed as an argument to X</li>\n<li>An object held in an instance variable of C</li>\n<li>A static field</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I try to put together a class myself as follows.</p>\n<pre><code>public class C {\n\n    X4 x4 = new X4();\n\n    public static final X5 X_5 = new X5();\n\n\n    public String cMethod() {\n        return &quot;C so cool bean!&quot;;\n    }\n\n    public String x1() {\n        return cMethod() + &quot;\\t hell yeah!&quot;;\n    }\n\n    public void x2() {\n        X2 x2 = new X2();\n        x2.sayHello();\n    }\n\n    public void x3(X3 x3) {\n        x3.x3Method();\n    }\n\n    public void x4() {\n        x4.x4Method();\n    }\n\n    public static void x5() {\n        X_5.x5Method();\n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I tried asking 3 AI models (ChatGPT 3.5, Gemini, Claude 3 Sonnet)\nEvery one of them provides different opinion,\nfor method <code>cMethod</code>, <code>x1</code> and <code>x3</code>, these follows LoD no doubt,\nbut what about <code>x2</code>, <code>x4</code>, <code>x5</code> ?\nQuestions listed below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Regarding violating LoD or not, does it matter that internal object -- X4 here, is accessed directly or by getter?</li>\n<li>If creating an instance inside x2 method is fine, how can x2 method be improved to follow LoD?</li>\n<li>I'm guessing x4 violates LoD because of the same reason as x2, access the instance's method inside clacc C? If so, how to improve this? Because AIs just declare another class with a method, and remain the exact method code as x4. And said that since it has an interface, it's ok now.</li>\n<li>x5 is simplifed, if to focus on whether calling a static field's method inside method x of class C, does it violates LoD?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I know for some it's time wasting to focus on theory or principles rather than real life challenge.\nIf any one can give some pointers that'll be fantastic.</p>\n"
