Most of this code is ai generated but I am stuck at a problem that even ai is not able to solve</p>\n<p>in this code the camera preview seems to works fine but for some reason I cannot get the arcore to work and get the orientation. in the log it shows that the state of arcore is paused but I don't know why. whats wrong?</p>\n"
