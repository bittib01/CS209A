    "title": "Wildcard address with fully-qualified-queue-name",
    "body": "<p>I am using Apache ActiveMQ Artemis 2.39.0 in an application that needs to process messages broadcast on a collection of topics with the same logic. Multiple instances of this application can be running, but only one instance of the application should do the processing. Other applications need to be able to subscribe to the topics so they can't just be queues.</p>\n<p>To accomplish this I have created an Apache Camel route which utilizes a wildcard address with a fully-qualified-queue-name. Since all instances should consume from this backing queue only one instance should actually process the message.</p>\n<p>The route source is specified in camel using the following URI:</p>\n<pre><code>jms:queue:application.event.#::application.process.event\n</code></pre>\n<p>The desired behavior is for the Camel route to consume any message on any topic that begins with <code>application.event</code>, but that is not happening. A message sent to <code>application.event.shutdown</code> is not received in the Camel route. Setting the source URI to instead be <code>jms:queue:application.event.shutdown</code> results in the message being received, so it's not a problem on the publishing side. Using a subscriber queue to subscribe to a single topic also seems to work <code>jms:queue:application.event.shutdown::application.process.event</code></p>\n<p>What could be going wrong here? Is there another way for me to guarantee that a message published to a collection of topics will only be processed by one instance of this application? Am I misconfiguring something?</p>\n<p>I have both <code>org:apache.activemq:activemq-client:6.16</code> and <code>org.apache.activemq:artemis-core-client:2.40.0</code> on my classpath.</p>\n"
