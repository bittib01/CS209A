This might happen because a process has files open or has its working directory set in the target directory.\n</code></pre>\n<p>The only way I can solve this is to manually delete certain packages from <code>node_modules</code> and <code>android\\build</code> folder, then rerun <code>gradlew clean</code>. I've tried to kill <code>gradlew</code> daemons but it didn't help.</p>\n"
