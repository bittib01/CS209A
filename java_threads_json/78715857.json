    "body": "<p>I tried the problem <a href=\"https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-student-that-will-replace-the-chalk/description/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Find the Student that Will Replace the Chalk</a> on LeetCode.</p>\n<blockquote>\nThere are n students in a class numbered from 0 to n - 1. The teacher will give each student a problem starting with the student number 0, then the student number 1, and so on until the teacher reaches the student number n - 1. After that, the teacher will restart the process, starting with the student number 0 again.\n<p>You are given a 0-indexed integer array chalk and an integer k. There are initially k pieces of chalk. When the student number i is given a problem to solve, they will use chalk[i] pieces of chalk to solve that problem. However, if the current number of chalk pieces is strictly less than chalk[i], then the student number i will be asked to replace the chalk.</p>\n<p>Return the index of the student that will replace the chalk pieces.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I thought my solution should work but there is on test case where it doesn't work and I don't understand why.</p>\n<p>Here is the <a href=\"https://gyazo.com/0b358ed4ea2ccd197756436322a85f56\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">test case</a>.</p>\n<p>And here is my code:</p>\n<pre><code>class Solution {\n    public int chalkReplacer(int[] chalk, int k) {\n        return getChalkReplacer(chalk, k);\n    }\n    public int getChalkReplacer(int[] chalk, int remaining_chalk){\n        int chalk_sum = 0;\n        for(int i=0; i&lt;chalk.length; i++){\n            chalk_sum += chalk[i];\n            if(remaining_chalk - chalk_sum &lt;= 0 || chalk[i] &gt; remaining_chalk){\n                return i;\n            }\n        }\n        return getChalkReplacer(chalk, remaining_chalk % chalk_sum);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n"
