    "title": "In Java Mission Control 9, how to remove some content that was previously &quot;Store and set as focused selection&quot;?",
    "body": "<p>In Java mission control 9 I am able to select various bits of information like time span, thread Id etc and use it to &quot;Store and set as focused selection&quot;. This globally changes all the views/pages to set the Focus and Aspect of the page to narrow down on information around the focus.</p>\n<p>But once I am done analyzing that focus area, I am not sure how to &quot;remove&quot; the focused selection globally. I searched through the PDF manual but could not find anything relevant. I know on each page I could select  for the focus page to sort of over-ride the global focus for that page temporarily, but that is not what I am looking for. I would like to know where I could clear out the selection so that I can start a fresh line of analysis.</p>\n"
