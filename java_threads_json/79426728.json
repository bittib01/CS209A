    "title": "Java send printjob to CUPS (socket printer)",
    "body": "<p>I want to send a print job to Cups and the printer is connected to CUPS via socket. I am looking for a solution for my Java program to send print jobs to the printer using a URL to CUPS.</p>\n<p>CUPS: <code>http://CUPS-IP-ADDRESS:631/</code></p>\n<p>Printer: <code>socket://PRINTER-IP-ADDRESS:PORT</code></p>\n<p>I tried a few packages to send print jobs to the printer. But nothing works. I think the problem is that all packages want an IPP printer, but the printer can't use IPP. Also, the printer can't print PDFs. That's why I need CUPS to do it.</p>\n<p>Packages I tried:</p>\n<p><strong>ipp-client</strong></p>\n<pre class=\"lang-xml prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;dependency&gt;\n    &lt;groupId&gt;de.gmuth&lt;/groupId&gt;\n    &lt;artifactId&gt;ipp-client&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n    &lt;version&gt;3.2&lt;/version&gt;\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>cups4j</strong></p>\n<pre class=\"lang-xml prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;dependency&gt;\n    &lt;groupId&gt;org.cups4j&lt;/groupId&gt;\n    &lt;artifactId&gt;cups4j&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n    &lt;version&gt;0.7.9&lt;/version&gt;\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>j4cups</strong></p>\n<pre class=\"lang-xml prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;dependency&gt;\n    &lt;groupId&gt;de.javatux&lt;/groupId&gt;\n    &lt;artifactId&gt;j4cups&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n    &lt;version&gt;0.6.1&lt;/version&gt;\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>For some reason, my printer cannot be found by the Java packages, especially printers that are registered as IPP and have IPP as a feature.</p>\n<p>I have CUPS in a Docker container, so I need the CUPS-IP-ADDRESS for CUPS. When I use the CMD-Line <code>lp -d MyPrinter srv/MyFile.pdf</code>, the print job prints correctly.</p>\n<p>If I use a CMD-Line to send a raw-file via telnet,<code>curl -v --upload-file srv/MyFile.raw-file telnet://PRINTER-IP-ADDRESS:PORT</code>, that also works. So I would expect that Java's socket class would do the same thing correctly with raw-files.</p>\n<p>But I want to do it with PDFs because the raw-files are complicated to create and PDFs are much easier. So can someone help me send a print job to CUPS for my socket-connected printer? I couldn't find any documentation on this, only for IPP printers. It shouldn't be that hard to send a print job to CUPS via an URL, but I haven't found out how to do it yet.</p>\n"
