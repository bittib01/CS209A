    "body": "<p>I have a Desktop app that uses SWT and other Eclipse libraries.</p>\n<p>Today I downloaded all the 4.36 libraries and updated the app to use them.</p>\n<p>Now it fails with this exception:</p>\n<p>Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; org.eclipse.swt.SWTException: Unsupported or unrecognized format [No SVG rasterizer found]</p>\n<p>This issue seems related to the issue I'm having: <a href=\"https://github.com/eclipse-platform/eclipse.platform.swt/issues/1965\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://github.com/eclipse-platform/eclipse.platform.swt/issues/1965</a></p>\n<p>Any suggestions on how to resolve this issue? I would like to move to the 4.36 libraries to take advantage of &quot;Monitor-Specific UI Scaling as Default (Windows only)&quot; (<a href=\"https://eclipse.dev/eclipse/markdown/?f=news/4.36/platform.md\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://eclipse.dev/eclipse/markdown/?f=news/4.36/platform.md</a>).</p>\n<p>My app uses .png graphics in menu items and toolbar items, but I understand that png graphics are deprecated in 4.36.</p>\n<p>Eric Bergman-Terrell</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/EricTerrell/Vault3.Desktop\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://github.com/EricTerrell/Vault3.Desktop</a></p>\n"
