    "title": "How to detect N+1 problems in a Hibernate/JPA application",
    "body": "<p>Given that <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/97197/what-is-the-n1-selects-problem-in-orm-object-relational-mapping\">N+1</a> has been the most pernicious problem with Hibernate/JPA applications for about 20 years, I was hoping there's a way of detecting it (before it's too late). Something like the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Install &quot;N+1 detector&quot; dependency</li>\n<li>Run the test suite</li>\n<li>The N+1 detector reports occurrences (or likely occurrences) of N+1 that were encountered during the test suite execution</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'm not sure how exactly this mythical N+1 detector would work, but if you could <a href=\"https://github.com/jdbc-observations/datasource-proxy\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">proxy the database queries</a> and notice that the same query is being executed multiple times in quick succession, then that's a likely case of N+1.</p>\n<p>However, I haven't actually found anything like this, does it exist? Is there any automated, or semi-automated way to detecting N+1?</p>\n<p>I'm not sure how relevant this is, but in my specific case I'm using Spring Boot 3.X with Spring Data JPA.</p>\n"
