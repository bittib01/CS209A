    "body": "<p>Say I have a model with a many to many or many to one relationship. This model would like this:</p>\n<pre><code>@Entity\npublic class A {\n  // other fields ...\n\n  @OneToMany(...)\n  private List&lt;B&gt; bEntities = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>There would be no reason to have a setter for this list but we would need a getter to be able to modify the list:</p>\n<pre><code>public List&lt;B&gt; getBEntities() { return bEntities; }\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this case, however, SpotBug is complaining about</p>\n<pre><code>EI_EXPOSE_REF: A.getBEntities() may expose internal representation by returning A.bEntities\n</code></pre>\n<p>I could map out the entire CRUD relationship into the model, like:</p>\n<pre><code>addB();\nfindBById();\n// and so on and so forth\n</code></pre>\n<p>but not only would that still expose B entities, but also be out of the responsibility of the model as far as I understand. What is the proper way of doing this? Should I just suppress the warning for JPA managed entities?</p>\n"
