    "title": "Why is virtual thread on java is set as daemon?",
    "body": "<p>In <a href=\"https://openjdk.org/jeps/444\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">JEP 444</a>, I could see the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Virtual threads are always daemon threads. The <code>Thread.setDaemon(boolean)</code> method cannot change a virtual thread to be a non-daemon thread.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But what is the reason behind it? As per my understanding , you will mark those Threads daemon whose completion you do not always care. Therefore, does it mean you should use virtual thread only if you do not care it's completion ( I do not think so :) )?</p>\n"
