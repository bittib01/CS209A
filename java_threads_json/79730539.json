    "title": "Maven dependency from source",
    "body": "<p>Is it's possible to use source repo as dependency instead of jar? I got few legacy projects in my selfhosted gitlab:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>core(child)</li>\n<li>api(parent)</li>\n<li>web(parent)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The &quot;core&quot; project is dependency for &quot;api&quot; and &quot;web&quot;. I have a problem with local build. If I use a regular way It's require hardcoded token in code or additional staff training to use their own system environment. And staff should be careful every time to avoid push their token to repo.</p>\n<p>The best way is ssh key in my view. But gitlab package registry work over http(s) only but not over ssh. If I can't download artifact over ssh then maybe I could download and build source from remote repo like it work with composer or npm. Is it possible for maven?</p>\n"
