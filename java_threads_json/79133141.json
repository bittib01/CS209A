    "body": "<p>I have a Spring Boot application (A1), and I need to invoke another application (A2) via Rest API. A1 is written in Java + Spring Boot while A2 is written in python and tornado. A1 is trying to invoke /Get that is exposed by A2. The /Get url is something like:\n<code>https:123.456:123/something?industry=Test Data O&amp;G Upstream - NA &amp; Europe</code>. The A1 application is encoding the above requestParam as <code>industry=Test+Data+O%26G+Upstream+-+NA+%26+Europe</code>. Based on my analysis till now it <code>&amp;</code> that is causing the issue.</p>\n<p>I am using <code>URLEncoder</code> to encode the value.</p>\n<p>The same request works on the postman but not with Spring Boot.</p>\n"
