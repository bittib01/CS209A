    "body": "<p>I'm writing a Maven plugin that parses the source code of the project where this plugin is called, and generates documentation based on certain rules.</p>\n<p>Now I have a question: when I have the source code of class A (including its comments) and I found that class A references another class B, how can I get the source code of class B?</p>\n<p>Class B may be in the same directory, in a different directory, or even in a Maven dependency's JAR.</p>\n<p>Of course, the dependency JAR may have been generated with the maven-source-plugin, in which case I should be able to get its source code, right?</p>\n<p>Can anyone give me some ideas or solutions on how to implement this requirement?</p>\n"
