    "body": "<p>I am going to improve and supplement this question but maybe I'm right and someone knowing can help shortcut this question/issue... Isn't the following web documentation by Oracle incorrect?  <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/2d/advanced/compositing.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/2d/advanced/compositing.html</a></p>\n<p>This seems to have been asked previously by the following post:\n<a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54269308/java-graphics-composite-inconsistencies\">Java Graphics Composite inconsistencies</a></p>\n<p>I have some sample code and some screenshots that I will add in the next few days but, again, I feel the web documentation is either wrong or strongly misleading on the examples it gives.  i.e.  I cannot duplicate the examples AT ALL!  At least not in the way they are described on the page.  At best, I can somewhat duplicate the screenshots in the web page but have to swap &quot;destination&quot; and &quot;source&quot; and even then the applied composites do not match the web page.  If I'm simply wrong and anyone has any insight that would help me understand the web page and java2d compositing as explained on that page, please let me know.</p>\n<p>FWIW, I'll go ahead and add some preliminary information.  Here is a screenshot of images created but they have swapped source and destination (as I am interpreting the tutorial).  These images have the composites applied in the following order:</p>\n<pre><code>        AlphaComposite.SRC,\n        AlphaComposite.DST,\n        AlphaComposite.SRC_ATOP,\n        AlphaComposite.DST_ATOP,\n        AlphaComposite.SRC_IN,\n        AlphaComposite.DST_IN,\n        AlphaComposite.SRC_OUT,\n        AlphaComposite.DST_OUT,\n        AlphaComposite.SRC_OVER,\n        AlphaComposite.DST_OVER,\n        AlphaComposite.CLEAR\n</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/6FyouOBM.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/6FyouOBM.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>UPDATE:  I have accepted Robby's answer and posted my own followup as an answer below.  Now... how to get Oracle to clarify/correct their tutorial... :)</p>\n"
