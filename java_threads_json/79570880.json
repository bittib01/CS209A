    "title": "Unchecked casts not showing anymore VSCode",
    "body": "<p>I was working on a Java project in VSCode and received a compiler warning for an unchecked cast:</p>\n<p>Type safety: The method put(Object, Object) belongs to the raw type HashMap. References to the generic type HashMap&lt;K,V&gt; should be parameterized.</p>\n<p>The Quick Fix gave me the option to &quot;Ignore compiler problem(s).&quot; I clicked on it to see what it would do, and it ended up disabling all unchecked cast warnings for this project only. How can I re-enable it? I tried searching for a setting to enable this again everywhere, but I couldn't find one.</p>\n<p>What is this setting called and where do i find it?</p>\n<p>I have searched the Internet and asked ChatGPT.</p>\n<p>-My .vscode/settings.json does not have anything related to this in it\n-My user settings don't have anything either</p>\n"
