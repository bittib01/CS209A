    "body": "<p>I have been going through all of the recommendations and none of them work. This is current code.</p>\n<pre><code>    @Override public void onBackPressed(){\n        if( isCustomKeyboardVisible() ) {\n            hideCustomKeyboard();\n            return;\n        }\n\n        if (isTaskRoot())\n            Utils.exitAlert(this);\n        else\n            super.onBackPressed();\n    }\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>Android Studio</p>\n<p>Doesn't recognize BuildCompat</p>\n<p>Doesn't recognize enableOnBackInvokedCallback</p>\n<p>Doesn't recognize getOnBackInvokedDispatcher()</p>\n<p>I'm thinking I need some kind of import, but AS doesn't suggest one.</p>\n<p>I want to avoid using AndroidX. Last time I tried it was too much work elsewhere.</p>\n<p>My phone was recently updated to Android 16.</p>\n<p>My last app release was Nov 27 and onBackPress worked. It may have been installed when it was still Android 15.\nThe new release does works on my Android 10.</p>\n<p>Setting enableOnBackInvokedCallback to false will not build.</p>\n"
