    "body": "<p>I have an OpenAPI description defined in its own library.</p>\n<p>This library is used as a gradle dependency in my project.</p>\n<p>I am using <a href=\"https://github.com/springdoc/springdoc-openapi/releases\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Springdoc v.2.5.0</a>.</p>\n<p>My project is a Spring Cloud Gateway.</p>\n<p>Currently, I am trying to start Swagger-UI and use the existing <code>Openapi.yml</code> that is inside the resources folder of the library. But in the <code>application.yml</code> I can't specify the yaml file directly.</p>\n<p>&quot;<code>classpath:/openapi.yml</code>&quot; for example doesn't work, Swagger-UI can't access it that way.</p>\n<p>So I looked into writing a Configuration Bean, as I can easily access the yaml file in Java directly, but can't find any way to pass the file to Springdoc or Swagger-UI.</p>\n<p>Does anyone know how to do it?</p>\n"
