    "title": "How can I use keep-alive messages to detect a disconnected user from game app?",
    "body": "<p>I'm developing a game app using Android Studio with java, and I'm using Firebase Realtime Database to handle connection and sending messages between users.\nIn this app multiple &quot;guests&quot; connect to 1 &quot;host&quot;, basically they all connect to a child of the database under the same game code and send messages there.</p>\n<p>My problem is that I want the host to be able to identify a sudden disconnection from one of the guests to eliminate him from the game. Similarly I want some actions done if the hosts disconnects.</p>\n<p>In addition to OnDisconnect in my guest activity:</p>\n<pre><code>playersRef.child(playerId).onDisconnect().setValue(myEnum.QUIT);\n</code></pre>\n<p>I wanted to implement a keep-alive message system, to cover all cases in which my app may terminate.</p>\n<p>I'm not sure how to implement this kind of system to run in the background of my app continuously while the game is taking place.\nI want the host to keep track of guests and be able to tell when one of those isn't there anymore.\nIs there a way to implement such class?</p>\n"
