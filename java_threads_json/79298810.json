    "title": "Lazy loading in spring core with component scan",
    "body": "<p>Let’s say I have a bean A with @ Lazy and @Component(“A”) annotations defined. However my configuration class has @Componentscan(basePackages=“…..”) where lazyInit param is not mentioned(false apparently if not provided). Will the bean A be lazily loaded still or do I need to add lazyInit=true to componentscan for bean A to be lazily loaded. This is for Spring core application not spring boot</p>\n<p>Expectation: we do not need to lazyInit value but without that beans will be lazily loaded</p>\n"
