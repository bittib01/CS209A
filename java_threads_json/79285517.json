    "title": "Is Using a Single Generic Repository for All Entities a Good Practice in Spring Data JPA for Large Project",
    "body": "<p>I’m working on a large Spring Boot application and I’m looking for advice on how to handle repositories for multiple entities. I want to avoid creating individual repositories for each entity and instead use a single, generic repository that can handle CRUD operations and custom queries for all entities dynamically.</p>\n<p>Here’s what I’m trying to achieve:</p>\n<pre><code>CRUD operations should work for any entity.\n\nCustom queries (e.g., searching by a field like email) may work on user entity\n\nI’m currently using JpaRepository for the implementation.\n</code></pre>\n<p>My question is:</p>\n<pre><code>Is it a good practice to use a single generic repository for all entities, especially in a large project?\n\nAre there any potential downsides or limitations to this approach?\n\nShould I stick to individual repositories for each entity for better maintainability and scalability?\n\nDo I need to add anything to this Spring folder structure?\n</code></pre>\n<p>Any code examples, insights, or best practices would be greatly appreciated!</p>\n<p>``</p>\n<pre><code>@Service\npublic class LoginService {\n    public boolean validateLogin(Map&lt;String, String&gt; credentials){\n\n        return true;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I need to check over multiple entities like users, branch, ect... so i need to create each repository for the project.</p>\n"
