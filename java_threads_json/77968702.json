    "body": "<p>Is there a way to register bean into bean container without any annotation like <code>@Producer</code>, <code>@ApplicationScoped</code> and so on?</p>\n<p>I know there is a <a href=\"https://www.baeldung.com/spring-5-functional-beans\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">way</a> to do it in Spring, but I can't find any way how to do it in Quarkus.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately I have to register <em>beans</em> during some business case and I can't use annotation like <code>@Producer</code> etc.</p>\n<p>What I have as an example:</p>\n<pre><code>if (isApplied) {\n    Config configuration = configService.createConfig();\n    // Register configuration as a bean with bean name\n    // to have ability to Inject it after\n} \n</code></pre>\n<p>And this part of code I have not at startup. It's during REST API execution.</p>\n"
