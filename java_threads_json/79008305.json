    "title": "Collecting distinct field value from an object in Java stream",
    "body": "<p>I am trying to collect distinct values of the one of the field in the object. I was hoping to use <code>distinct()</code> over stream however it can't be applied on field level. I have used Map to get the list mapped to object. Is there a way to get list of field only?</p>\n<p>I have Employee object with ManagerId and I would like to collect distinct ManagerId list.</p>\n<p>My Map Solution</p>\n<pre><code>Map&lt;Long, Employee&gt; employeeMap =employees.stream()\n     .collect(Collectors.toMap(Employee::getManagerId, Function.identity(), (o, n) -&gt; n);\n</code></pre>\n<p>I am looking to get <code>List&lt;Long&gt; managerIds = .....</code></p>\n"
