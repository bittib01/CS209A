    "body": "<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ROIQ4.png\" alt=\"This\" /></p>\n<p>is representative of the type of maze I want to make. The walls don't occupy spaces, they just prevent you from moving between them. Since the walls aren't 2d tiles I don't think I'd use a 2d boolean array to represent it. I am not asking for help with how to generate a maze, just how to represent one of this type.</p>\n"
