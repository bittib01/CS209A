    "body": "<p>I was trying to set up Oracle SOA Suite on my PC. After extracting the jar files and running CMD as administrator, the installation proceeds smoothly until JDeveloper is launched. The application does not start at all:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Unable to launch the Java Virtual Machine Located at path: &quot;C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk-1.8\\bin\\msvcr100.dll</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I really don't understand how this can be possible. I checked, this library is, in fact, present within the desired path, I have no idea what to do.</p>\n<p>I would like to know if by any chance there is a way to be able to launch JDeveloper correctly and resolve this missing library error that is actually not missing.</p>\n"
