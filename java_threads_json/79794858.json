    "title": "Updating a JTextField from the inside of a Java for loop",
    "body": "<p>The purpose of my program is to do time-consuming file operations that are executed inside a for loop.\nThat's why I would like the program to show the current operation through a text field.\nI don't know how to explain it in a simpler way.\nI can't post the whole program because it would be too long.</p>\n<p>I can't find a way to update a <strong>JTextField</strong> field while a loop is running inside a method.</p>\n<p>For example, in a loop like:</p>\n<pre><code>void Test() {\n    ArrayList&lt;String&gt; asList = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\n    // Load asList.\n    for (int jj=0; jj &lt; asList.size(); jj++) {\n      // Miscellaneous instructions working on files.\n      TxtLog.setText(jj + &quot; &quot; + asList.get(jj));\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <strong>TxtLog</strong> field is never updated.</p>\n<p>How do I get it to update while running the for loop?</p>\n<p><strong>EDIT: I solved with SwingWorker associated with a Thread.sleep!</strong></p>\n"
