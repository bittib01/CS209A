    "body": "<p>I wanted to take (almost the first) steps towards Java and IntelliJ Idea, installed JDK (21.0.7 community editon) and IntelliJ IDEA 2025.1 (Community Edition) on my Ubuntu. Started the IntelliJ and discovered there is tutorial IdeaLearningProject and took it for introduction. Step 6 in this tutorial is <strong>running the current file</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/WxD1IOvw.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/WxD1IOvw.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>As you may see from the screenshot:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>the run-button is inactive</li>\n<li>the tooltip says &quot;The file in the editor is not runnable&quot;</li>\n<li>neither does help the shortcut.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>After googleing the &quot;not runnable&quot;-tip and trying different solutions (which did not help, but closely furter below) I thought to create first sample project with simplest code to test, does this run?</p>\n<p>So I created New -&gt; Project and ticked the option &quot;add sample code&quot;. Without changing anything I clicked the run-button which:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>deactiveted the buttton (as in tutorial)</li>\n<li>outed some error:</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Error running 'Main'\ncom.android.tools.idea.gradle.dcl.lang.DeclarativeParserDefinition\nPluginClassLoader(plugin=PluginDescriptor(name=Gradle Declarative\nSupport, id=com.android.tools.gradle.dcl, descriptorPath=plugin.xml,\npath=~/bin/intellij/plugins/android-gradle-declarative-lang-ide,\nversion=251.23774.435, package=null, isBundled=true),\npackagePrefix=null, state=active,\nparents=PluginDescriptor(name=Kotlin, id=org.jetbrains.kotlin,\ndescriptorPath=plugin.xml, path=~/bin/intellij/plugins/Kotlin,\nversion=251.23774.435-IJ, package=org.jetbrains.kotlin,\nisBundled=true), PluginDescriptor(name=Gradle, id=com.intellij.gradle,\ndescriptorPath=plugin.xml, path=~/bin/intellij/plugins/gradle,\nversion=251.23774.435, package=null, isBundled=true),\nPluginDescriptor(name=Java, id=com.intellij.java,\ndescriptorPath=plugin.xml, path=~/bin/intellij/plugins/java,\nversion=251.23774.435, package=null, isBundled=true), )</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This error does not make any sense to me.</p>\n<p>So what have I tried? After googleing some suggestions were:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>mark directory as &quot;Sources Root&quot;. tried, it was already. unmarked and marked again. nothing changed</li>\n<li>restore IDE default settings. Did, restarted, nothing changed.</li>\n<li>&quot;It looks like you have not added a run configuration&quot;-answer in SO <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/78779175/196241\">https://stackoverflow.com/a/78779175/196241</a> notices &quot; I tried to add some, but I have no clue, what this conf should contain. I tried some examples provided there, but nothing worked. So I created project with sample code, but this did not include also any run configuration. Should it?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The sample Main class looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code>public class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        System.out.printf(&quot;Hello and welcome!&quot;);\n\n        for (int i = 1; i &lt;= 5; i++) {\n            System.out.println(&quot;i = &quot; + i);\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>If I try to run it, it directs me to edit configuration, from the selection the &quot;Applications&quot; seems the only viable of options, but after choosing it and running I get warning:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Configuration is still incorrect. Do you want to edit it again?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If I opt to continue, I get error:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Error running 'Unnamed'\nNo main class defined</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My problem seems to be bind to some kind of configuration file (for build system?), but why is this missing? How should I know what is missing, already in tutorial-phase?</p>\n<p>I'd like to find the answer in IntelliJ-context, swapping to other IDE is next path, if needed. As you already assumed, yes, I am totally stranger to Java ecosystem.</p>\n"
