    "title": "Have long text scroll to the right when using JTextField .setText()",
    "body": "<p>I have a JTextField for displaying the path of a selected folder. It's intentionally disabled (as the folder is supposed to be chosen with a JFileChooser), and when the program starts, a default folder path is set as the text using setText().</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>trainOutputFolderField = new JTextField(20);\ntrainOutputFolderField.setEnabled(false);\ntrainOutputFolderField.setText(getSourcePath()+&quot;training-output/&quot;);\ntrainGBPanel.add(trainOutputFolderField, b);\n</code></pre>\n<p>I would like it to automatically scroll to the right edge of the text when it's longer than the field, while otherwise remaining left-justified. This is what is does by default if you manually type into the text field, but it keeps it anchored to the left if you use setText().</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/9ree3mKN.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Enabled JTextField text entry vs disabled JTextField setText</a></p>\n<p>I'd like the user to be able to see the end of the path in the disabled text field. Using setHorizontalAlignment() with either RIGHT or TRAILING doesn't seem to do anything, although that probably wasn't the solution to begin with since I want the text to remain left-justified when it's shorter than the field. Fiddling with the caret position didn't seem to do anything either.</p>\n<p>Any ideas?</p>\n<p>I went and actually set up the ActionListener with the aforementioned JFileChooser and when it sets the text through that it works exactly how I want it, so the problem only seems to occur when I set the text in the JFrame's initialization. I still need to display the folder path by default though, so I'm still looking for an answer.</p>\n<p>Here's a slimmed-down version of the JFrame's init with all the other components removed:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>import javax.swing.*;\n\nimport java.awt.FlowLayout;\nimport java.awt.GridBagConstraints;\nimport java.awt.GridBagLayout;\nimport java.awt.Insets;\nimport java.awt.event.ActionEvent;\nimport java.awt.event.ActionListener;\n\npublic class MainFrame extends JFrame {\n    \n    public JTabbedPane tabbedPane;\n    public JPanel trainPanel;\n    public JPanel trainGBPanel;\n    \n    // There are more components, but I've removed them for demonstration\n    public JTextField trainOutputFolderField;\n    public JButton trainOutputFolderButton;\n    \n    public MainFrame() {\n        setTitle(&quot;Yeehaw&quot;);\n        setSize(500, 500);\n        setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);\n        setLayout(new FlowLayout(FlowLayout.CENTER));\n        \n        tabbedPane = new JTabbedPane();\n        \n        trainPanel = new JPanel(new FlowLayout(FlowLayout.CENTER));\n        trainGBPanel = new JPanel(new GridBagLayout());     \n        GridBagConstraints b = new GridBagConstraints();\n        b.anchor = b.WEST;\n        b.gridy = 0;\n        b.gridx = 0;\n        b.insets = new Insets(5,5,5,5);\n        \n        trainGBPanel.add(new JLabel(&quot;Output folder&quot;), b);\n        b.gridx += 1;\n        b.gridwidth = 2;\n        trainOutputFolderField = new JTextField(20);\n        trainOutputFolderField.setEnabled(false);\n        trainOutputFolderField.setText(&quot;yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeehaw&quot;);\n        trainGBPanel.add(trainOutputFolderField, b);\n        b.gridx += b.gridwidth;\n        b.gridwidth = 1;\n        trainOutputFolderButton = new JButton(&quot;Select&quot;);\n        trainOutputFolderButton.addActionListener(new FileChooserListener(this, trainOutputFolderField));\n        trainGBPanel.add(trainOutputFolderButton, b);\n        \n        trainPanel.add(trainGBPanel);\n        tabbedPane.add(&quot;TRAIN&quot;, trainPanel);\n        \n        this.add(tabbedPane);\n        this.setVisible(true);\n    }\n    \n    public class FileChooserListener implements ActionListener {\n        \n        public MainFrame mainFrame;\n        public JTextField textField;\n        \n        public FileChooserListener(MainFrame mainFrame, JTextField textField) {\n            this.mainFrame = mainFrame;\n            this.textField = textField;\n        }\n        \n        @Override\n        public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {\n            // There's JFileChooser stuff in here, but I've removed it for simplicity\n            trainOutputFolderField.setText(params.trainOutputFolder);\n        }\n        \n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Also, I'm on Windows 10 and the LookAndFeel is &quot;com.sun.java.swing.plaf.windows.WindowsLookAndFeel&quot;, if that means anything.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Note: JayC667's comment did the trick!</p>\n"
