    "title": "Unnecessary warnings for Freemarker classes on native image execution",
    "body": "<p>I am developing a command line app with freemarker. I want to build the app as a graalvm native image using the native-maven-plugin. When I start the app on the command line (zsh on MacOS), I get the following warning:</p>\n<pre><code>Aug. 01, 2024 10:25:29 PM freemarker.log._JULLoggerFactory$JULLogger warn\nWARNUNG: Seems that the Java 9 support class (freemarker.core._Java9Impl) wasn't included in the build\n\nAug. 01, 2024 10:25:29 PM freemarker.log._JULLoggerFactory$JULLogger warn\nWARNUNG: Seems that the Java 16 support class (freemarker.core._Java16Impl) wasn't included in the build\n</code></pre>\n<p>I have already tried to include the two classes <code>_Java9Impl</code> and <code>_Java16Impl</code> in the image using the native image build option <code>--initialise-at-build-time=org.freemarker._Java9Impl</code>. Without success.</p>\n<p>I have also tried to simply use the two classes in my application so that they are included in the native image. To do this, I added the following code to my app, which actually makes no sense:</p>\n<pre><code>_Java9 j9 = _Java9Impl.INSTANCE;\n_Java16 j16 = _Java16Impl.INSTANCE;\nif (LocalDate.now().isBefore(LocalDate.of(1970,1,1))) {\n    System.out.println(j9.toString() + j16.toString());\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Unfortunately without success, the two warnings are still displayed. What do I have to do to make the two warnings disappear?</p>\n"
