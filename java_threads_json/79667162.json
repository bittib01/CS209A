    "title": "EJB remote Entity Bean",
    "body": "<p>I would like to use EJB remoting to access the remote interface of a Session Bean and retrieve an Entity Bean (or a POJO).</p>\n<p>The Entity Bean implements an interface and I would except the bean to be serialized to a Proxy Bean that implements the same interface. This way, the client would not need the implementation class code.</p>\n<p>So the question is: Why is the data being transferred by Session Bean not being proxied or what do I have to do to make that work? I am using OpenEJB on TomEE.</p>\n"
