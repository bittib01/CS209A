    "body": "<p>I am trying to integrate AppDynamics Machine Agent with my Azure Function App. I have downloaded and placed the Machine Agent in the directory /opt/appdynamics/machine-agent and I want to execute it using the command ./bin/machine-agent. However, I am running into issues with Azure Function App not allowing the execution of this command.</p>\n<p>Here’s what I’ve tried so far:</p>\n<p>I attempted to run the command directly within the Azure Function App,\nI created a script to execute the command and placed it in the startup folder for the Function App, but this also didn’t work.\nHow can I dynamically start the AppDynamics Machine Agent within my Azure Function App without manual intervention? Are there specific steps or configurations I need to follow in Azure to execute system commands or scripts like this from a Function App?</p>\n<p>Environment:</p>\n<p>Azure Function App (Linux)\nAppDynamics Machine Agent\nTrying to run command from /opt/appdynamics/machine-agent\nThanks in advance for your help!</p>\n"
