    "title": "Find the position offsets of highlights instead of just strings containing the fragments",
    "body": "<p>The problem is instead of fragments from highlighting I really just need the positions of the highlighted word(so their start and end offsets). My original solution(but in Java) is quite similar to the solution here, where they use the token stream to score each token: <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/39185606/3543214\">https://stackoverflow.com/a/39185606/3543214</a></p>\n<p>However as the comment on that solution suggests, what I really need is to find a way to make this work for more than just single tokens. The issue I'm having now is if my query is to search for &quot;The cow jumped&quot; I get hits on &quot;the&quot; &quot;cow&quot; and &quot;jumped&quot; even when they arent together. Any ideas?</p>\n"
