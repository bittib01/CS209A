    "title": "JavaFX WebView shows Rectangles for line breaks in HTML Source",
    "body": "<p>I use a JavaFX WebView control to display some static HTML documents inside my application. Unfortunately, the line breaks from the HTML file are displayed as rectangles in the WebView.</p>\n<p>For the snippet below from the HTML file it looks like the screen shot underneath:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;Users can also have roles within the application, and they can be\n    members of groups; both can be defined freely, although some sample roles\n    and groups will be created with the installation.&lt;/p&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<hr />\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/0kq2rbXC.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/0kq2rbXC.png\" alt=\"Appearance in WebView\" /></a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Note the rectangles between <code>be members</code> and <code>roles and</code>. When copying the sequence and pasting it to a text editor, there are no special characters (therefore I have to present a screen shot here …).</p>\n<p>Use this MWE to reproduce the issue:</p>\n<pre><code>import javafx.application.Application;\nimport javafx.scene.Scene;\nimport javafx.scene.layout.VBox;\nimport javafx.scene.web.WebView;\nimport javafx.stage.Stage;\n\npublic class MWE extends Application\n{\n\n    public static void main( String... args )\n    {\n        launch( args );\n    }\n\n    public void start( Stage primaryStage )\n    {\n        primaryStage.setTitle( &quot;Minimal Working Example&quot; );\n\n        final var webView = new WebView();\n\n        webView.getEngine().loadContent(\n            &quot;&quot;&quot;\n            &lt;p&gt;Users can also have roles within the application, and they can be\n              members of groups; both can be defined freely, although some sample roles\n              and groups will be created with the installation.&lt;/p&gt;\n            &quot;&quot;&quot;\n        );\n\n        final var vBox = new VBox( webView );\n        final var scene = new Scene( vBox, 960, 600 );\n\n        primaryStage.setScene( scene );\n        primaryStage.show();\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I am using Java 21.0.1 with JavaFX 21.0.3 on Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS. And originally, the HTML is read from a file.</p>\n<p>Just as a side node: when I translate a Markdown file to HTML and display the result, I see the same rectangles on where the Markdown source had the line breaks.</p>\n<p>Any ideas how I could get rid of those rectangles? Other than reformatting the HTML, of course.</p>\n"
