    "body": "<p>I have an activity method which I want to run in async. I tried using Async. procedure method to run the activity async but since this was the last statement of the workflow, it got scheduled but did not get picked. Is there any way to wait for the activity to get picked?</p>\n<p>Here is the example code</p>\n<pre><code>private final MyActivity myActivity = Workflow.newActivityStub(MyActivity.class, activityOptions);\n@Override\npublic SomeObject execute(Payload payload){\n    SomeObject someObject = myActivity.methodA(payload);\n\n    // Calling some more activities here based on the result of someObject\n\n    Async.procedure(myActivity::methodB, payload);\n    return someObject;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Since</p>\n<pre><code>Async.procedure(myActivity::methodB, payload);\n</code></pre>\n<p>is just before return statement, its get scheduled but did not start execution as workflow has ended.</p>\n"
