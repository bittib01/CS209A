    "title": "Java : getting sorted order of Objects",
    "body": "<p>I have an List of Objects that implements the Comparable Interface that I want to sort.  I do not want the original List returned sorted, nor do I want an new List returned in sorted order.  What I want returned is an int[] that reflects the sorted order of the original list.</p>\n<p>If have a List of Integers = { 50, 40, 30, 20, 10 }, what I want returned is an int[]{ 4,3,2,1,0}.</p>\n<p>What I currently do is create an IndexedComparable for each entry in the original List that has the object at each index and also the original index of the object.  This IndexedComparable has a compareTo() method that compares the 2 objects stored in the 2 IndexedComparables.  I then sort this List of IndexedComparables and after sorting, extract the index for each entry into an int[].  This works fine, but I have arrays that I need to sort that are millions of entries long, meaning I need to create millions of the IndexedComparables Objects. Is there a cleaner way of doing this?</p>\n"
