    "body": "<p>I'm trying to figure out how to use the <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/aggregates\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Aggregate values at write time</a> preview feature in Bigtable. The documentation states that this should be possible to do using the Java API, but there are a couple of things that I find confusing:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The documentation above states that I need to add an aggregate column family to the table. This implies that this is a special type of column family, but I can't find any way to specify a type, in Terraform or in the GUI.</li>\n<li>The <code>RowMutation</code> class of the Java API does include an <code>addToCell</code> method that will do the <code>sum</code> aggregation, but I can't find any way to do the <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> aggregations listed in the documentation.</li>\n</ol>\n"
