    "title": "Encrypt data on client side using cryptoJs and decrypt on server side SFCC (Java) Cipher",
    "body": "<p>My project requires several storefront network requests to be encrypted and sent over, so thats its not interpreted by any outsider and pose a threat to the system or user. Typically sensitive or customer specific data shouldn`t be sent over as clear text.</p>\n<p>My request occurs through front end (client side) ajax and processed at the back end. The back end logic involves submitting the received data to an external API. But since the external API supports data only in clear text format, the data has to be encrypted at client side, consecutively received and decrypted back to clear text froamt at the server side. Thereafter forwarding it to the API from server side itself.</p>\n<p>My back end is based out SFCC (Salesforce Commerce Cloud built on Java having SFCC API`s for server side logics) and I need suitable API`s do the job communicating betwee client and server side.</p>\n"
