    "title": "Cleared or overwritten Java printed lines stopping program",
    "body": "<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>I am fairly new to non-scratch programming,\nand am working on a program in Java that mimics a screen by reading and printing a 2D array. The program currently prints out the array, waits for a specified duration, and then runs the lines <code>System.out.flush();  System.out.print(&quot;\\033[H&quot;);</code>\nThe program <strong>successfully prints out the array</strong> and currently resets the cursor which makes the program print the new frame over the new one.</p>\n<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>\n<p>The problem is that the <strong>program slows down and stops</strong> after enough time has passed despite the fact that only the last frame is shown in the box if you scroll up or down. If I use a different IDE, it kills the process earlier because the output exceeds 2 MB. Also, each frame is fairly large and need to be updated rapidly.</p>\n<p><strong>Modules</strong></p>\n<p>The whole reason that I used text instead of a screen is because <strong>I cannot import many modules.</strong> My best guess is that I cannot use anything that requires you to access the computer's terminal to import, or are not immediately available on a free online IDE, but I don't know what exactly I can and can't import.</p>\n<p><strong>Intent and Question</strong></p>\n<p>The intent of this program is to have the most recent block of text be shown, and the previous blocks to be deleted without causing flashing.</p>\n<p>Is there a way to <strong>overwrite</strong> the the output so that the code can run for a long time without reducing performance significantly?</p>\n<p>-Clearing the output fully instead of overwriting the old frame makes the output flash pretty badly as the text prints.</p>\n<p><strong>Code</strong></p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>System.out.print(&quot;\\033\\143&quot;);\n</code></pre>\n<p>has the same issue.</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>System.out.println(new String(new char[50]).replace(&quot;\\0&quot;, &quot;\\r\\n&quot;));\n</code></pre>\n<p>does not properly clear the output.</p>\n<pre><code>System.out.print(&quot;\\033[2J&quot;);\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Successfully stops the program from slowing down, but makes the output flash</strong> as it prints the next chunk of text.</p>\n<p>Here is a sample of code that recreates the way that the array prints:\n(This is not the actual code, but mimics the final output of the code which is causing the problem)</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>public class Tester {\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\n    int rows = 50;\n    int cols = 50;\n    while (true) {\n      for (int i = 0; i &lt; rows; i++) {\n        for (int g = 0; g &lt; cols; g++) {\n          System.out.print(&quot;a&quot;);\n        }\n        System.out.print(&quot;\\n&quot;);\n      }\n\n      //thing that clears output\n      System.out.flush();\n      System.out.print(&quot;\\033[H&quot;);\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n"
