    "title": "How can I increase the survival cycle of an object moving from young generation to old generation heap space in java",
    "body": "<p>I have a spring boot application development which is processing an memory intensive process for an amount of time which is let than 5 mins. It will create lots of objects created and it will be destroyed at the end of the processing time. During this time those objects are getting moved from young generation memory to old generation as it's survived some number of GC cycle.</p>\n<p>I need to control this since it's not necessary to have the unused memory reference object in the old generation memory.</p>\n<p>Could anyone please help me on how to configure the GC ARGUMENTS SO THAT the minimum lifetime objects should not be moved to old generation Heap space?</p>\n"
