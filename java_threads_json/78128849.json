    "title": "How to inject KieRuntimeBuilder - (Migrating to Drools 8)",
    "body": "<p>I need to migrate to Drools 8 while touching as little code as possible. I have been following their <a href=\"https://docs.drools.org/8.29.0.Final/drools-docs/docs-website/drools/migration-guide/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">guide</a> which says that I need to replace the <strong>KieContainer</strong> with the <strong>KieRuntimeBuilder</strong>.</p>\n<p>The issue is instantiating this value. I have added the kogito-legacy dependency and the documentation claims that you simply add the @Inject annotation and that Kogito will inject the value for you.</p>\n<p>That did not work of course since it wasn't picked up as a Spring bean but even after adding the external package to the ComponentScan, it still gets the same error - No qualifying bean of type 'org.kie.kogito.legacy.rules.KieRuntimeBuilder' available: expected at least 1 bean which qualifies as autowire candidate.</p>\n<p>I've add these dependencies to my pom -</p>\n<pre><code>            &lt;dependency&gt;\n                &lt;groupId&gt;org.drools&lt;/groupId&gt;\n                &lt;artifactId&gt;drools-engine&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n                &lt;version&gt;${version.drools}&lt;/version&gt;\n            &lt;/dependency&gt;\n            &lt;dependency&gt;\n                &lt;groupId&gt;org.kie.kogito&lt;/groupId&gt;\n                &lt;artifactId&gt;kogito-legacy-api&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n                &lt;version&gt;1.20.0.Final&lt;/version&gt;\n            &lt;/dependency&gt;\n            &lt;dependency&gt;\n                &lt;groupId&gt;org.kie.kogito&lt;/groupId&gt;\n                &lt;artifactId&gt;kogito-quarkus-rules&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n                &lt;version&gt;1.44.1.Final&lt;/version&gt;\n            &lt;/dependency&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>There is another <strong>KieRuntimeBuilder</strong> available from Drools. Even though the instructions are to add the kogito-legacy version, I also tried the other. Although this also failed, it seems a little closer to the mark as the bean was at least successfully created (but as null) -</p>\n<pre><code>Caused by: java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot invoke &quot;org.kie.api.runtime.KieRuntimeBuilder.getKieBase()&quot; because &quot;this.kieRuntimeBuilder&quot; is null\n</code></pre>\n"
