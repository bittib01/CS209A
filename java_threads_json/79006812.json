    "title": "Handle exception thrown from static block",
    "body": "<p>I was confused by a program exiting silently without entering <code>main</code>, which turned out to be because a <code>System.loadLibrary</code> call in a static block threw <code>UnsatisfiedLinkError</code>. To narrow the problem down, this is a construct that makes the program fail silently:</p>\n<pre><code>public class T {\n    static void bad() {\n        throw new RuntimeException(&quot;Terror error!&quot;);\n    }\n\n    static {\n        System.out.println(&quot;in static&quot;);\n        bad();\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        System.out.println(&quot;in main&quot;);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>When this is run, the process exits silently after printing only “in static”, with exit code 1. At least that is what happens with my current Java environment, “OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Homebrew (build 22.0.2, mixed mode, sharing)”.</p>\n<p>Of course this can be fixed with a try-catch block around the <code>bad</code> call, but what if there isn’t such a block because it was unclear to the programmer it was needed? (Someone could have done this sort of thing in a library outside of my control, for instance.) Is there any way to hook in to handle an <code>Error</code> or <code>RuntimeException</code> thrown from a static block, to at least get a message that shows where the problem occurred?</p>\n"
