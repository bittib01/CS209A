    "title": "BufferedImage.Type_INT_RGB and BufferedImage.TYPE_INT_ARGB drawing differently?",
    "body": "<p>I noticed that when trying to draw a square with a black border for BufferedImage graphics it works fine if it is instantiated as TYPE_INT_RGB but it deforms if the BufferedImage was made as TYPE_INT_ARGB seemingly only putting the border on the left and top of the square.</p>\n<pre><code>icon = new BufferedImage((int) width, (int) height, BufferedImage.TYPE_INT_ARGB);\n        Graphics2D g = icon.createGraphics();\n        g.setColor(Color.yellow);\n        g.fillRect(0, 0, (int) this.width-1, (int) this.height-1);\n        g.setColor(Color.BLACK);\n        g.drawRect(0, 0, (int) this.width, (int) this.height);\n        g.dispose();\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you try it and get rid of the A in TYPE_INT_ARGB you see what I mean. It is no problem with the squares but it becomes one when I draw circles. In fact, it looks like it is drawing the contents further down and to the left then it does as TYPE_INT_RGB.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Da9jcO54.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Da9jcO54.png\" alt=\"Screen shot showing the problem\" /></a></p>\n"
