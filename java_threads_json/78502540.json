    "title": "Debugging a function which returns the intersection of two linked lists",
    "body": "<p>I tried to solve following <a href=\"https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-linked-lists/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Leetcode problem</a> where you have to find the intersection-node of two linked lists, and return it (or null, if there is none).</p>\n<p>I know there are simpler solutions than the one I came up with, but I'd like to know whats wrong with my approach:</p>\n<p>Let x be the number of nodes between the start of list A and the intersection; same for y and list B. And let z be the distance between the intersection and the end of the lists (see picture).</p>\n<p>Let's assume that list A is longer than B, therefore y&lt;x.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ykmcyvU0.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ykmcyvU0.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>If I let two pointers start from the heads of both lists, the pointer of B is going to reach the end while pointer A is still in the list. Both pointers traveled the same distance y+z. Since list A is longer than B by (x+z)-(y+z) = (x-y), pointer A is at the node (y+z)-(x-y) = z-y. Now I save this pointer in the variable &quot;middle&quot; and I let another pointer &quot;newStart&quot; start at the beginning of B. If I let both of them traverse the list, &quot;middle&quot; is going to reach the end after y nodes so pointer &quot;newStart&quot; will be at position y (the intersection).</p>\n<pre><code>public static ListNode getIntersectionNode(ListNode headA, ListNode headB){\n        // First iteration\n        ListNode firstA = headA;\n        ListNode firstB = headB;\n        ListNode middle;\n        ListNode newStart;\n        while (true){\n            if (firstA.next==null){\n                middle = firstB;\n                newStart = headA;\n                break;\n            }\n            if (firstB.next==null){\n                middle = firstA;\n                newStart = headB;\n                break;\n            }\n            firstA = firstA.next;\n            firstB = firstB.next;\n        }\n        // second iteration\n        while (middle != null){\n            middle = middle.next;\n            newStart= newStart.next;\n        }\n        return newStart;\n    }\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>However this doesn't work, and I'm having a hard time debugging and understanding whats wrong in my code.</p>\n"
