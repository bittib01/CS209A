    "body": "<p>I am creating an android app (using Java), and I want to use an effect in my main menu:</p>\n<p>My background image is an ImageView. I've set the source to a drawable. What I would like to do is have it start as a cropped area of that picture, then gradually fade to another point in that picture with the same width and height (without going outside the picture of course), with a random point in the picture every time.</p>\n<p>How would I go about doing this in Android Studio using Java?</p>\n"
