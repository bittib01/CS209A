    "title": "When uninstalling IntelliJ Idea Community does it also delete downloaded Java SDK",
    "body": "<p>I installed IntelliJ Idea 2025.1.1.1 Community version. I imported Java project and since it's fresh OS (Windows 11) installation I didn't have Java installed. Idea asked my if I wanted to download Java SDK and I installed Java Oracle OpenJDK 24 on custom path on non-system drive. I added it to environment path and I can use it from anywhere (from cmd) and it works.</p>\n<p>I'm wondering, when I uninstall Idea will it also delete downloaded Java or will it somehow break my using of that downloaded Java?</p>\n<p>PS<br />\nI know I could try uninstalling Idea and see for myself, but at this time it is not an option.</p>\n"
