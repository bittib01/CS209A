    "title": "Displaying an Android Auto App on a Real Head Unit Without Play Store Listing",
    "body": "<p>This week, I developed an Android Auto app that displays specific numbers retrieved through an API. The app corresponds to the Android Auto Design Guidelines. It functions well within the AA Emulator on a PC. However, I encounter difficulties in getting it to display or work on an actual car's head unit. I understand that uploading the app to the Play Store can resolve this issue, but I'm interested in exploring alternative methods, since it's only for my personal use.</p>\n<p>For instance, tools like AAAD (Android Auto Apps Downloader) facilitates the installation of uncertified apps on a car's system. But it only has a specific list of apps that they decide, and I can't put my own app into it.</p>\n<p>Does anyone have experience or knowledge on how to display and operate a custom Android Auto app on a real head unit without having to list it on the Play Store? Any guidance or workarounds would be greatly appreciated</p>\n"
