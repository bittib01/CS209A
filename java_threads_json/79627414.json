    "body": "<p>I am trying out unit testing in Java with JUnit for an assignment.\nPreviously, we were tasked with creating a generic puzzle-solving algorithm using graph searching algorithms.</p>\n<p>The important part is that I have an interface called Graph Vertex.</p>\n<pre><code>public abstract class GraphVertex { \nabstract public List&lt;GraphVertex&gt; getAdjacentVertices();\n    abstract boolean equals(Object o);\n    abstract int hashCode();\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This allows the user to swap between different node types if he so wishes.</p>\n<p>Now, I have a concrete class called SliderPuzzleVertex&lt;T&gt; that extends GraphVertex, and holds a 2-dimensional array of T and a set of positions (x, y) that are considered empty.\nThe getAdjacentVertices generates new SliderPuzzleVertex-es of every possible move that can be made.</p>\n<p>I need to test getAdjacentVertices for this class.</p>\n<p>Using Integer as my parameterized T, I initialized an instance and called the method, and now I am left with a List&lt;GraphVertex&gt;, but I want to test:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>That they are all SliderPuzzleVertex.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Their fields (for example, that the size if their position set remained the same),</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Specific cases where i give the input and expected output, and check that they are same using equals().</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You can easily see that in order to test 2 I would have to cast them to SliderPuzzleVertex, therefore relying on test 1. This test case dependency is what I am trying to avoid</p>\n<p>How can I approach this problem?</p>\n"
