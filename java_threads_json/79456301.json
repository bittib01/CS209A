    "body": "<p>I have an akka based application, and it has Application.java file which has structure like what we have defined <a href=\"https://github.com/akka/akka-http-quickstart-java.g8/blob/main/src/main/g8/src/main/java/%24package%24/QuickstartApp.java\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Now I want to write integration tests for akka http endpoints in this application, as discussed <a href=\"https://doc.akka.io/libraries/akka-http/10.7/quickstart-java/testing-routes.html#a-note-integration-testing-routes\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>It says that I need to launch application in @BeforeClass method.</p>\n<p>So how do I start application. I guess merely calling main function wont work as it would block the program and tests would never hit.</p>\n"
