I would rather execute some assumption that tests if my <code>BasicRobot</code> can do anything at all. I refer to <code>org.fest.swing.core.BasicRobot</code> / <code>org.assertj.swing.core.BasicRobot</code>.</p>\n<p>I would rather avoid displaying an auxiliary <code>Window</code> <code>@BeforeEach</code> (or even <code>@BeforeAll</code>).</p>\n<p>This, on the other hand, relies on an initial pointer location which makes it a bit fragile.</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>    @BeforeEach\n    void testRobot() {\n        PointerInfo initialPointerInfo = MouseInfo.getPointerInfo();\n        Point initialLocation = initialPointerInfo.getLocation();\n        robot.moveMouse(initialLocation.x + 5, initialLocation.y + 5);\n        PointerInfo subsequentPointerInfo = MouseInfo.getPointerInfo();\n        Point subsequentLocation = subsequentPointerInfo.getLocation();\n        assumeFalse(Objects.equals(initialLocation, subsequentLocation), &quot;Robot commands ignored.
