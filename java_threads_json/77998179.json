    "title": "How can I get uploaded image to display immediately after upload in a spring boot application?",
    "body": "<p>I've looked through various questions on stack overflow dealing with this but haven't found any conclusive solution. So basically in my project currently, I have it so that a user can upload an image and the image then gets stored in the static/resources folder. I followed this tutorial when creating the file storage service:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://spring.io/guides/gs/uploading-files\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://spring.io/guides/gs/uploading-files</a></p>\n<p>My issue is that the file upload is successful but the uploaded image isn't viewable unless I reload the project, and that isn't really what I want it to do. I would prefer if when I upload an image, when the user goes back to the page the image is immediately viewable there. I've tried many of the solutions I found for it, such as uploading to a folder outside of static, but I'm not sure how to access these files in thymeleaf, another solution I found was to upload to the target folder, but unfortunately that didn't seem to work either and others.</p>\n<p>The relevant files are below:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;div class=&quot;works&quot; id=&quot;works&quot; th:each=&quot;applications: ${applications}&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;div class=&quot;works__item&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;img class=&quot;works__photo&quot; th:src=&quot;@{/images/services/{image}(image=${applications.imageName})}&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;form th:action=&quot;@{/admin/evcharging}&quot; th:method=&quot;get&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;works__content&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;div class=&quot;works__title&quot; th:text=&quot;${applications.applicationName}&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n                &lt;div class=&quot;works__text&quot; th:text=&quot;${applications.applicationType}&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n                &lt;button class=&quot;btn btn--red btn--long&quot;&gt;Learn more&lt;/button&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/form&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>The controller to create the attribute is below:</p>\n<pre><code>@GetMapping(&quot;/adminLanding&quot;)\npublic String adminLanding(Model model) {\n    String currentUserName = &quot;&quot;;\n    Authentication authentication = SecurityContextHolder.getContext().getAuthentication();\n    if (!(authentication instanceof AnonymousAuthenticationToken)) {\n        currentUserName = authentication.getName();\n    }\n    if(!currentUserName.isEmpty()){\n        List&lt;Application&gt; applications = applicationRepository.findByAdminAdminID(adminRepository.findByUsername(currentUserName).getAdminID());\n        model.addAttribute(&quot;applications&quot;, applications);\n    }\n    return &quot;adminLanding&quot;;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The storage properties are below:</p>\n<pre><code>@ConfigurationProperties(&quot;storage&quot;)\npublic class StorageProperties {\n    private String location = &quot;src/main/resources/static/images/services&quot;;\n\n    public void setLocation(String location) {\n        this.location = location;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And this project was done on intellij if that is relevant.</p>\n"
