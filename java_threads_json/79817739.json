    "body": "<p>During performance test we got some error from Azure Storage saying that</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>com.azure.storage.blob.models.BlobStorageException: Status code 409, &quot;<Code>BlobAlreadyExists</Code>The specified blob already exists. RequestId:53c64237-701e-0086-6766-52cc7f000000</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The obvious reason would be that we want to use the same id to upload the blob to Azure.<br />\nHowever what we have is</p>\n<pre><code>@Override\npublic String storeQuote(final JsonNode quote) {\n    final String uuid = UUID.randomUUID().toString();\n    try {\n        final String blobName = BLOB_PREFIX + uuid;\n\n        LOGGER.debug(&quot;Uploading content to blob[{}].&quot;, blobName);\n        BlobClient blobClient = blobContainerClient.getBlobClient(blobName);\n        blobClient.upload(BinaryData.fromObject(quote));\n        LOGGER.debug(&quot;Upload was successful to blob [{}].&quot;, blobName);\n\n        return uuid;\n    }\n    catch (Exception e) {\n        throw new AzureBlogStorageErrorException(&quot;Error occurred when stored the quote in to Azure Blob Storage!&quot;, e);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I can hardly imagine that we had 10+ times UUID collision in 1-2 hours performance test (I am just joking, obviously it can't happen or I am just very-very-... unlucky).</p>\n<p>Any idea please what the issue can be please?</p>\n<p>//////////////////////// question 1 ////////////////////////<br />\nI haven't set any retry mechanism, can this problem be caused by that? Is there a default retry if nothing is set? As far as I know there isn't but I am not 100% sure.</p>\n"
