    "body": "<p>Rate Limit Gatling-grpc users outbound requests/second\nWe are working on one a critical project and executing load tests using <a href=\"https://github.com/phiSgr/gatling-grpc\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://github.com/phiSgr/gatling-grpc</a> framework targeting GRPC specific services. We are trying to limit the number of outbound requests from gatling GRPC user like only 1 req/sec. currently as part of our test, each of the GRPC user is making more than 500 reqs/sec.</p>\n<p>As per Gatling documentation <a href=\"https://gatling.io/docs/gatling/reference/current/core/scenario/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://gatling.io/docs/gatling/reference/current/core/scenario/</a> we could leverage pace for normal http requests like\nforever().on(\npace(5)\n.exec(\n// will be run every 5 seconds, irrespective of what pause time is used\npause(1, 4)\n)\n);</p>\n<p>Would be good to have this pace like method for gatling-grpc as well so as to limit our GRPC clients.</p>\n<p>No clear workaround thought of currently. Is there any temporary workaround within gatling-grpc on how to limit the outbound requests/sec for GRPC users ?</p>\n<p>tried to use the pace method within our gatling-grpc java client code.</p>\n"
