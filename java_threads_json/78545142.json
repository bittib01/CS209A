    "title": "Java record does not have default builder",
    "body": "<p>Java came with records which are really useful and can avoid use of library like <a href=\"https://projectlombok.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Project Lombok</em></a>. But can someone please help me understand why records does not support <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Builder pattern</a> by default? I understand records are immutable but the Builder pattern also gives immutability.</p>\n<p>So, basically I have to use Lombok's <code>@Builder</code> in records or implement by my own to use builder pattern, which could be avoided if records had a builder by default.</p>\n"
