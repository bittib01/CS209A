    "body": "<p>I am currently working on a project that has a part of it that reads and writes from a file. Everything in my code works but I don't want to use an absolute path for the program to find the file because I want it to work on all devices. However when I put the file in the directory with my source code using new FileWriter(&quot;Pokemon.txt&quot;); it cannot detect the file, this goes for when I put it into the root folder as well. How do I fix this I've searched everywhere and I have no idea what to do.</p>\n<pre><code>public static void pokeWrite() {\n            //Writing to a file\n            \n            String filePath = &quot;Pokemon&quot;;\n            //Creates Scanner\n            Scanner scnr = new Scanner(System.in);\n            \n            //Takes user input for length of array \n            \n           System.out.println(&quot;How many pokemon do you want to add?&quot;);\n           int pokeAmount = scnr.nextInt();\n          \n           //Creates the Array\n           String[] pokeArr = new String[pokeAmount];\n           \n           //Takes user input for the Strings depending on the size of the array\n           System.out.println(&quot;Please enter these Pokemon now&quot;);\n           for(int i = 0 ; i &lt; pokeAmount; i++){             \n               pokeArr[i] = scnr.next();            \n           }\n      \n           \n           try{\n\n          //Uses Buffered writer to check the location file and see if the file exists.\n           BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(filePath, true));\n           \n           //Writes to the file with the inputed value and creates a new line.\n           //Loops through the array adding each string the user inputed to the file.\n           for (String pokemon : pokeArr){\n           writer.write(pokemon + &quot;\\n&quot;);\n           //Closes writer.\n        \n           }\n              //Closes writer.\n              writer.close(); \n           }\n           //Catch exception in case file cant be found.\n           catch (IOException e){\n               e.printStackTrace();\n           }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>public static String[] pokeRead() {\n        \n        \n        int pokeAmountRead = pokeLineCount();//Uses the pokeLineCount() function to aqquire the amount of lines in the file.\n        String[] pokeReadArr = new String[pokeAmountRead];//Creates an array using the pokeAmountRead int.\n        \n        try{\n          \n        BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(&quot;Pokemon.txt&quot;));\n        //Creates reader to take information in from the file.\n      \n        String pokeLine;//Creation of string value to be used later on.\n        \n//        System.out.println(&quot;Number of lines: &quot; + pokeAmountRead); //Used for testing to see amount of lines in file\n      \n        int pokeCount = 0;//Creates Counter for while loop.\n        \n        while((pokeLine = reader.readLine()) != null){ //Calls pokeLine to store each line of the file until the file reaches its end.\n            \n            pokeReadArr[pokeCount] = pokeLine;//Places value from file in the array designated by the counter\n            \n//            System.out.println(pokeReadArr[pokeCount] + &quot;This is in the while loop in pokeRead&quot;); //Testing to see if the array is getting the values.\n            pokeCount++;//Increases counter\n        }\n       \n        \n    }\n        catch (IOException e){\n            e.printStackTrace();//Shows the information on the throwable if one occurs.\n        }\n      return pokeReadArr;//returns the array\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>If Anyone knows how to fix this please let me know.</p>\n"
