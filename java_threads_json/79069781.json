    "title": "Gradle Build Fails with &quot;Unsupported class file major version 65&quot; After Updating to Java 17",
    "body": "<p>I’m working on a Flutter project and recently updated to Java 17. Since the update, my build fails with the following error when trying to run assembleDebug:</p>\n<p>FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What went wrong:\nCould not open cp_settings generic class cache for settings file '.../android/settings.gradle'.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>BUG! exception in phase 'semantic analysis' in source unit '<em>BuildScript</em>' Unsupported class file major version 65</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It seems to be related to Gradle and Java compatibility. I’ve already tried updating the gradle-wrapper.properties to a Gradle version that supports Java 17, but the error persists. Here's what I’ve done so far:</p>\n<p>Updated gradle-wrapper.properties to use Gradle version 7.3.3:</p>\n<p>distributionUrl=https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-7.3.3-bin.zip\nEnsured Java 17 is installed and set as the default JAVA_HOME on my system.</p>\n<p>Flutter doctor output confirms that Flutter is using Java 17.</p>\n<p>Despite these steps, the build continues to fail. Here's the full error output:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>BUG! exception in phase 'semantic analysis' in source unit '<em>BuildScript</em>' Unsupported class file major version 65</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Steps I’ve Tried:\nUpdating Gradle to 7.3.3 in gradle-wrapper.properties.\nRunning flutter clean and rebuilding the project.\nEnsuring JAVA_HOME is pointing to the correct Java 17 installation.\nEnvironment:\nFlutter version: (specific version)\nJava version: 17\nGradle version: 7.3.3 (set in gradle-wrapper.properties)</p>\n<p>This is my build.gradle code</p>\n<pre><code>compileOptions {\n    sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_17\n    targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_17\n}\n\nkotlinOptions {\n    jvmTarget = '17'\n}    \n</code></pre>\n<p>P.S. All of this started when i updated Android Studio to the Ladybug version</p>\n"
