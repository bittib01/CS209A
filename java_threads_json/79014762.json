    "body": "<p>I am new to Flink and trying to use Flink with Kafka as data input and iceberg for storing the data.\nHere are the steps I have done.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Read A Datastream of java POJOs from kafkaSource (with a Avro schema).</li>\n<li>Convert the Datastream of POJOs to DataStream RowData by using MapFunction wrapper.</li>\n<li>Send the DataStream of RowData to Iceberg using FlinkSink.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Everything works but My concern is with the way I am converting the DataStream of POJOs to DataStream of RowData. I have a complex and pretty big POJO reference and to convert it to RowData, I had to use .setField() method for each and handle each dataType transformation like StringData,Map, List etc.</p>\n<p>I wanted to check here, if there is a better way to do this.</p>\n"
