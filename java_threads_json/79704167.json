    "title": "Is there a way in *any* JVM language to implement two interfaces with some method(s) with the same signature but different return types",
    "body": "<p>So, I need to have an object implement two interfaces that both require a method with the same signature as each other, but different return types. Something like these two:</p>\n<pre><code>interface FooPrinter {\n    void foo(String bar);\n}\n\ninterface FooGiver {\n    String foo(String bar);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I don't control either of these interfaces, so I can't change the method names. This answer: <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32560313/implement-two-interfaces-with-the-same-method-signature-but-different-return-typ\">Implement two interfaces with the same method signature but different return type</a>\nsays that the JVM can run code that does this, but the Java language forbids it.</p>\n<p>Is there any JVM language that allows you to do this, and how? It needs to be callable when cast to one of the two interfaces, from any JVM language, and not just the one used to compile it. It doesn't need to be callable from the concrete class. If this is possible in Groovy, I would prefer this, since it's the language my project is using. However, I should be able to incorporate a different language into my project if I need to.</p>\n"
