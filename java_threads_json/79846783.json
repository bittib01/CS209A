My version has no meaningful impact on the code, for the purpose of this question you can read the <a href=\"https://github.com/ulfjack/ryu/blob/master/src/main/java/info/adams/ryu/RyuDouble.java\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">original file</a>.</p>\n<p>I'm writing coverage test for my application and I cant find a double value, parameter of the function <code>public static String doubleToString(double value)</code>, that will lead the subsequent call to <code>private static int decimalLength(long v)</code> return 1.</p>\n<p>The <code>decimalLength</code> function is called <a href=\"https://github.com/ulfjack/ryu/blob/1264a946ba66eab320e927bfd2362e0c8580c42f/src/main/java/info/adams/ryu/RyuDouble.java#L241\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">only once here</a> to compute a variable called <code>vplength</code> like this <code>final int vplength = decimalLength(dp);</code>.</p>\n<p>The <code>decimalLength</code> function simply count the number of digits, base 10, of whatever long is passed to it. So the problem is finding a double value that will make the <code>dp</code> value &lt; 10.</p>\n<p>There are not a lot of comment in the original code so I am having troubles finding out the solution. I started reading the <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3296979.3192369\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ACM article</a> but it will take some time.</p>\n"
