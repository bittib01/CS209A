    "title": "“String value length exceeds maximum allowed” when uploading large file in JSON",
    "body": "<p>I'm building a Spring Boot application where I'm trying to upload files or large content through a REST endpoint. The request is being rejected by Spring Boot with this warning:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>HttpMessageNotReadableException: JSON parse error: String value length (20048537) exceeds the maximum allowed (20000000, from StreamReadConstraints.getMaxStringLength())</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It looks like Jackson is blocking the request because the JSON string is too large. I'm not trying to catch this exception, I just want to understand:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Why this limit exists</li>\n<li>Whether I'm uploading the file in the wrong way</li>\n<li>What the correct approach is for handling large file uploads in Spring Boot</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Has anyone dealt with the <code>StreamReadConstraints</code> max string length issue?\nWhat is the recommended way to upload large files without hitting this JSON size restriction?</p>\n"
