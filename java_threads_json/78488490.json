    "title": "React Native OAuth2 Backend for Frontend With Spring Cloud Gateway BFF",
    "body": "<p>Hello I am using learning about OAuth.  I have a react native app, and I want to connect it to my Java Spring backend, with OAuth.  I used this tutorial to add OAuth to my Java backend: <a href=\"https://www.baeldung.com/spring-cloud-gateway-bff-oauth2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.baeldung.com/spring-cloud-gateway-bff-oauth2</a>, and now I want to connect my react native app, but from what I understand I need a token.</p>\n<p>How can I sign in users with the app?  I can't find any examples that allow me to use this backend.</p>\n<p>I have tried authenticating through the browser and redirecting, but even if I manage to sign in no other requests work.</p>\n"
