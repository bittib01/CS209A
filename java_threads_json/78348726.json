    "title": "Intellij “Parsing Java” notification, slow to build JavaFX project after MacOS Sonoma Upgrade",
    "body": "<p>Recently I upgraded MacOS from Monterey to Sonora.  One of issues after upgrading is slowness in the build process to launch JavaFX window in debug “Run” mode.  Anytime I make a change to the code, even putting a newline, and “Run” the code, I receive a “Parsing Java” notification.  This can take up to 10 - 20 seconds.</p>\n<p>Prior to the upgrade, I never saw a “Parsing Java” notification and the JavaFX window opened within 2 seconds.</p>\n<p>NOTE: I have been developing JavaFX on IntelliJ for several year, and never experienced this type of issue.  It was only after I upgraded my MacOS to Sonoma that this happened.  I use an M1 Mac with 32GB Memory, never any issue until upgrade to Sonoma.</p>\n<p>INTELLIJ\nIntelliJ IDEA 2024.1 (Community Edition)\nBuild #IC-241.14494.240, built on March 28, 2024\nRuntime version: 17.0.10+8-b1207.12 aarch64</p>\n<p>MAVEN\nVersion 3.9.6</p>\n<p>JAVA\nJava 1.8.0_4028\nAzul Zulu OpenJDK (JDK FX) for Mac ARM 64-bit\n(OpenJFX is included by Zulu)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/cvRz4.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/cvRz4.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n"
