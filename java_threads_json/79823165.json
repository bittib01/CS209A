    "title": "Issue With Jsoup Document Selector",
    "body": "<p>I'm using java spring boot and jsoup and recently I upgraded jsoup version to <code>1.21.1</code>.</p>\n<p>My code creates search query and searches for it in the document</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>Elements targetElements = document.select(createSearchQuery(strings)));\n</code></pre>\n<p>Recently however, this isn't working as expected. When search query gets too long (specifically, when query is over 2050 characters) I get <code>SelectorParseException</code></p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>org.jsoup.select.Selector$SelectorParseException: Did not find balanced marker at '\\&lt;string' at org.jsoup.select.QueryParser.parse(QueryParser.java:57)...\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note that this issue happens regardless of what the document contains, it only seems to depend on the length of the query.\nFor example, this query causes exception:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java

haven't found any mention of this issue online. Does anyone know why this happens? Is this a bug? Is there a new feature that there's now a limit to the length of a selector?</p>\n"
