    "title": "Best way to format based on multiple conditions in a MessageFormat",
    "body": "<p>When using <code>MessageFormat</code> I've noticed it's not easy to use more than one argument as a condition to format text. An example would be placing <code>&quot; and &quot;</code> between two values (e.g. like with durations: <code>&quot;1 hour and 20 minutes&quot;</code>), if and only if they are both non-zero. At two conditions, the only solution I've found is nested sub-formats and is fairly verbose:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-kotlin prettyprint-override\"><code>&quot;{0}{0,plural,=0{} other{{1,plural,=0{} other{ and }}}}{1}&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<p>And introducing a third condition would make this even worse.</p>\n<p>I would expect there to be a way to have a union of conditions. Theoretically something like:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-kotlin prettyprint-override\"><code>&quot;{0}{plural,0=0&amp;1=0{} other{ and }}{1}&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Is there a better way to achieve this behavior while still only using MessageFormat? Even if using custom subformats or rules?</p>\n"
