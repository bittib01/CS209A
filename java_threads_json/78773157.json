    "body": "<p>I've 9 bit fields every bit field has 9 nine bits, the 9 LSBs of an int.\nI want to find the bit position(s) which are exactly set twice over all bit fields.</p>\n<p>e.g:</p>\n<pre><code>    0.1111.1111\n    0.0000.1101\n    0.0001.1101\n    0.0001.1101\n    0.0010.1101\n    0.0010.1101\n    0.0100.1101\n    0.0100.1101\n    0.0000.0010\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this example its bit position 1 because at this position the 1 is exactly set two times.</p>\n<p>The first time in the first bit field, the second time in the last bit field.</p>\n<p>Currently I do a <code>&quot;positional population count&quot;</code> on ints.\nfor every possible bit field, there are 512, I have a corresponding long bit mask,\nwhich is used to count the frequency of set bit positions.</p>\n<p><code>0.0100.1101 -&gt; 0000.0000.0001.0000.0000.0001.0001.0000.0001</code></p>\n<p>I sum up the 9 long bit masks of the 9 bit fields.\nSo the first 4 LSBs of the sum represent the frequency bit 0 is set.\nThe second 4 bits represent the frequency bit 1 is set.\nAnd so on, so I can scan for a frequency of 2.</p>\n<p>This works, but its not as fast as I hoped.</p>\n<p>Is there a faster algorithm which I can implement in Java?</p>\n<p>I don't need to know all bit positions with a frequency of 2, just one bit position is fine.</p>\n"
