    "title": "Remove substring from string that consists of same words but different separators between them",
    "body": "<p>In my Java program I have the two strings x and y.</p>\n<p>String y is a substring of x. It contains the same words in the same order as x, but the words are separated in different ways.</p>\n<p>String x contains &quot; &quot; and &quot;\\n&quot; as separators.\nString y contains &quot; &quot; and &quot;\\r\\n&quot; as separators.</p>\n<p>Note that y contains separators at places where x does not contain separators.</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<pre><code>String x = &quot;Hello, \\nI am a cool \\nstring and that \\nis nice.&quot;\nString y = &quot;Hello, \\r\\nI am a \\r\\ncool \\r\\n \\r\\nstring&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<p>I want to remove the substring y from the string x, while x needs to keep every &quot;\\n&quot;.\nSo for the example my final string should be:</p>\n<pre><code>String final = &quot; and that \\nis nice.&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Extra info: This problem occurs in my JavaFX application. The user can enter a text which should be printed in a PDF file (string x in the example above). The text is too long for one field in the PDF. That's why I need to scan the text of the field (string y), remove it from the user-input-string (string x), and add the shortened string (string final) to the next field in the PDF. String y contains more separators than x because the text is wrapped in the PDF field, which creates extra line breaks.\nSee this post for more information: <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79581684/how-to-retrieve-only-the-visible-inside-of-border-text-of-pdfield\">How to retrieve only the visible (inside of border) text of PDField?</a></p>\n"
