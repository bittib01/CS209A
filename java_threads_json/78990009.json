    "body": "<p>I am dynamically building SQL queries in Java using JDBC and need to determine the best approach for handling these queries efficiently.\nCurrently, I am debating between using StringBuilder or StringBuffer for constructing the queries. I understand that StringBuffer is synchronized and thread-safe, while StringBuilder is not.</p>\n<p>The application generates multiple queries based on user input.\nQueries might involve conditions, joins, and subqueries, so the query building process can be dynamic and complex.</p>\n"
