    "body": "<p>I am in the process of upgrading our core application to run on updated libraries - specifically the latest LTS Java version (OpenJDK 21) along with Tomcat 10.1 - which includes the Jakarta library migration.</p>\n<p>Part of our application contains an integration with Crystal Reports for our reporting - and we host the Crystal Report Runtime as part of this on the same Tomcat instance.</p>\n<p>We are currently using the 2020 runtime, but after having a look at the options available, it seems all are reliant on javax classes (which are not available in the newer versions of Java given the Jakarta migration changes).</p>\n<p>I have tried several versions of the Crystal Report Viewer - such as the 2020 build, and the latest runtime included in Crystal Report For Eclipse - both have the same errors about javax classes not being present - indicating that the Crystal Report Runtime seems to be still relying on Java 8 classes (javax.servlet in particular).</p>\n<p>Downloads were from here: <a href=\"https://origin.softwaredownloads.sap.com/public/site/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://origin.softwaredownloads.sap.com/public/site/index.html</a></p>\n<p>Are there any versions of the Crystal Reports Runtime which work on the latest LTS builds of Java, given it's EOL coming in the next few years?</p>\n<p>Happy to switch runtimes if there is one released, it is quite possible I missed one if it exists - but any advice would be greatly appreciated.</p>\n"
