    "title": "How do I implement multi-inheritance DUPLICATE method in Java?",
    "body": "<p>I have an 8-level hierarchy of classes in Java. This is useful so each abstract class implements methods that are common in the whole sub-branch of the tree. That's working fine.</p>\n<p>However, after going back and forth with some design I realized some behavior is applied very discretionary to some leaf nodes only. There's no clear rule, that could follow the existing hierachy. I have identified these leaf classes and I wanted to understand what's the best way of implementing those, since the logic is EXACTLY the same one every time.</p>\n<p>For example, in the simplified example below only the green leaf classes should implement the method.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/3GYOMXEl.png\" alt=\"example tree\" /></p>\n<p>If I create a separate interface with the abstract method declaration I could mark all those leaf classes to implement the method.</p>\n<p>How can I place the logic in the new interface somehow? I don't want to copy the same code 80 times, in each affected tree class.</p>\n"
