    "body": "<p>There is a notion that &quot;singleton implementation of enum is thread-safe by default&quot; which I found in this <a href=\"https://www.javatpoint.com/java-singleton-enum\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">article</a> at javatpoint.com.</p>\n<p>If that is the case then does this mean that any method which I write myself inside of this enum singleton class is thread-safe as well without the need to use any additional keywords/logic to make it thread-safe?</p>\n"
