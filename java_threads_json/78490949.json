    "title": "Overwriting and deleting linked list elements",
    "body": "<p>I was solving following <a href=\"https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-linked-list-elements/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">leetcode problem</a>, where given a linked list, you're supposed to remove all the ListNodes that have a certain value val.</p>\n<p>I know the best solution is to directly remove the nodes from the list, but I tried something different:</p>\n<pre><code>public ListNode removeElements(ListNode head, int val) {\n    // copy wanted values from linkedlist into list\n    List&lt;Integer&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\n    ListNode current = head;\n    while (current != null){\n        if (current.val != val){\n            list.add(current.val);\n        }\n        current = current.next;\n    } \n\n    // overwrite the values of the first few nodes\n    current = head;\n    for(Integer num : list){\n        current.val = num;\n        current = current.next;\n    }\n\n    // disconnect the last node from the remaining ones\n    current.next = null;\n    return head;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>So for example if list (1 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 5) is given with val=3:\nAt first I save all the values that aren't 3. Then I overwrite the same list (1 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 5 -&gt; 5) and then I delete the pointer to the remaining nodes (1 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 5).</p>\n<p>I know the problem asks to remove the nodes and not to overwrite them, but since I'm not supposed to solve in place I figured it shouldn't matter.</p>\n<p>But this doesn't work: The first nodes are always correct, but there are almost always nodes from the original list which should have been disconnected. And I don't know why setting the last pointer to null doesn't get rid of them.</p>\n<p>I know that this isn't how you're supposed to solve this problem, but I can't figure out why it shouldn't work this way.</p>\n"
