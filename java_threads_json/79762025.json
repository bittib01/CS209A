    "title": "What is a .so file in Java projects, and how can I use an old JAR that depends on .so files in Spring Boot?",
    "body": "<p>I have an old Java JAR file that depends on .so files (shared object libraries).</p>\n<p>I understand .so files are native libraries (written in C/C++), and the JAR uses JNI (Java Native Interface) or JNA to load them.</p>\n<p>In my old project, this JAR worked fine because the .so files were placed in the right location and loaded automatically.</p>\n<p>Now, I’m migrating to Spring Boot (3.x, Java 17), and I want to reuse this JAR.\nMy questions are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>What exactly is a .so file in the context of Java? Why is it needed?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>How should I include these .so files in a modern Spring Boot application so that the JAR can still use them?</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Should they be put in src/main/resources?</p>\n<p>Or do I need to set java.library.path at runtime?</p>\n<p>Or is there a Spring Boot–specific way of packaging native .so files with my application?</p>\n<p>To clarify: the JAR I’m using is an internal project JAR (not a public library), and it relies on some .so files for its functionality. The JAR itself is fixed (I can’t change its code), so I need guidance on the best way to structure or configure the Spring Boot project so it can still load the .so at runtime.</p>\n"
