    "title": "Issue with ant to exit when java process return code 1",
    "body": "<p>I am using <code>ant</code> to trigger my java process using <code>&lt;exec&gt;</code>. A exact ant target written similar to below</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;target&gt;\n   &lt;exec dir=&quot;${dir}&quot; executable=&quot;${root}/rcc&quot; failonerror=&quot;true&quot; resultproperty=&quot;exit.code&quot;&gt;\n       \n   &lt;/exec&gt;\n&lt;/target&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Inside <code>&lt;exec&gt;</code> I am also passing few arguments using <code>&lt;arg&gt;</code>. It was perfectly working when I was using java-8 in <code>rcc</code> but after upgrade to java-11 it was stop working when process return exit code <code>1</code> while it still working when process return exit code 0. In case of return code 1 ant process remain stucked.</p>\n<p>A strange part is it works perfectly fine when <code>rcc</code> process return successfully with code <code>0</code></p>\n<p>I have tried by placing <code>-Djdk.lang.Process.launchMechanism=fork</code> without any luck. Can you please help to understand what could be the problem and solution to it?</p>\n<p>I using ant version <code>1.9.4</code> and running on <code>RHEL 8.10</code></p>\n"
