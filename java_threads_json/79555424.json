It takes several days for complete execution.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>How do I debug what's going on?</p>\n<p>It is not possible to add print statements throughout the code; or keep watching Jconsole for hours.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Can we run the process so that when it exits, we get a heap dump to\nanalyze?</li>\n<li>When the process exits, what can we do to capture as much useful info\nas possible to help with root causing the issue?</li>\n<li>Which other tools are available to help us with this type of\ninvestigation?</li>\n</ul>\n"
