    "title": "Storing biometric data in a PDF without breaking the digital signature",
    "body": "<p>I'm developing a tool that stores a signer's biometric data inside a PDF together with the digital signature, but I'm unsure where this information should be embedded.</p>\n<p>The biometric data is captured through a specialized signature pad, and I need to embed the dynamic/biometric data in the PDF at the moment the digital signature is applied.</p>\n<p>I first tried storing the data in custom metadata, but that doesn't seem like good practice. Then I attempted to place it in the signature dictionary, but Adobe marks the signature as invalid. I also tested storing it in an extended DSS, but modifying that structure wouldn't invalidate the signature.</p>\n<p>From what I understand, the correct approach would be to store the data somewhere <em>inside the signed PDF</em>, encrypted, such that any modification would break the signature. My plan is to encrypt the biometric data with AES-256 before embedding it.</p>\n<p>However, I haven't found much technical documentation on where this should be stored. Some providers offer this feature, but treat their implementations as a black box.</p>\n<p><strong>Where in the PDF file structure is it appropriate—and technically correct—to store encrypted biometric data so that it is covered by the digital signature?</strong></p>\n"
