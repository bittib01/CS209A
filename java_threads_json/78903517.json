    "body": "<p>I am using project reactor library, where I am fetching data from couchbase. The retrieval of data from couchbase is taking 2 sec which is causing latency issue.</p>\n<p>There is a thread blockage from project reactor which is causing delay.</p>\n<p>Instead of project reactor, I tried with spring binder and it was working fine, but I want to use project reactor only and know the issue for thread blocking.</p>\n<p>Code:</p>\n<pre><code>Reactive&lt;String, data&gt; client;\n\npublic Mono&lt;Wrapper&gt; process(Wrapper wrapper) {\n    watch.start();\n    return client.get(wrapper.getEvent().getId(), Data.class)\n            .doOnNext(data -&gt; {\n                watch.stop();\n                wrapper.setData(Data);\n            })\n            .thenReturn(wrapper);\n}\n\n</code></pre>\n"
