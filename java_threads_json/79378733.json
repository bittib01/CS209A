    "title": "Register external conversions for interface in MapStruct Spring Extension",
    "body": "<p>In my Spring boot application I use Mapstruct with the Spring extensions. All my mappers implement the <code>Converter</code> interface from Spring as well so I can use the <code>ConversionService</code> to map between my objects. Now I have a bunch of classes which all implement an interface and to convert between these classes I have created a <code>ConverterFactory</code>. This is picked up by MapStruct and I can convert between my objects nicly if I annotate my config with:</p>\n<pre><code>externalConversions = { \n    @ExternalConversion(sourceType = String.class, targetType = DomainModel1.class)\n    @ExternalConversion(sourceType = String.class, targetType = DomainModel2.class)\n    ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Unfortunately I have to register every single domain model here. Is there a better way to do this so I can just register it once for my shared Interface of all these classes?</p>\n"
