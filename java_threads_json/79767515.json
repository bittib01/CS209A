    "body": "<p>Say I have for example this XML</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;Account&gt;\n  &lt;AccountValidTo/&gt;\n&lt;/Account&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>where <code>AccountValidTo</code> is defined in XSD as <code>xs:dateTime</code>. I have Java classes generated from the XSD using jaxb2-maven-plugin.</p>\n<p>JAXB unmarshaller (<code>org.springframework.oxm.jaxb.Jaxb2Marshaller</code>) fails on this XML (<code>IllegalArgumentException</code> in Java), because empty value cannot be parsed as a date. I understand that. The obvious solution is to leave out the element entirely. However, these XMLs are coming from 3rd party so I have no control over what they send. Yes, they should comply to the specification and produce/send valid XMLs, however, persuading them to do this is a long shot, so I would prefer to have a solution on my side.</p>\n<p>Is it somehow possible to tell the unmarshaller to skip <code>xs:dateTime</code> elements if they are empty? (I would prefer XSD-only solution if one exists - e.g. the field in question in the generated class would have some annotation that would tell the unmarshaller to do what I need. Adding the annotation there manaully is not really an option, since the class is generated. Or maybe <code>org.springframework.oxm.jaxb.Jaxb2Marshaller</code> supports this by configuration or some code extension.)</p>\n"
