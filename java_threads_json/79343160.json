    "body": "<p>I am trying to run an azure function that I wrote in Java locally using <code>func start</code>. This doesn't work and this is the error message that I'm getting:</p>\n<pre><code>PS C:\\Users\\UserName\\Pictures\\PowerPages\\styringsgruppen-powerpages-site\\Java\\vscode&gt; func start\n\nAzure Functions Core Tools\nCore Tools Version:       4.0.6610 Commit hash: N/A +0d55b5d7efe83d85d2b5c6e0b0a9c1b213e96256 (64-bit)\nFunction Runtime Version: 4.1036.1.23224\n\n[2025-01-07T13:56:37.775Z] No job functions found. Try making your job classes and methods public. If you're using binding extensions (e.g. Azure Storage, ServiceBus, Timers, etc.) make sure you've called the registration method for the extension(s) in your startup code (e.g. builder.AddAzureStorage(), builder.AddServiceBus(), builder.AddTimers(), etc.).\nFor detailed output, run func with --verbose flag.\n[2025-01-07T13:56:43.088Z] Host lock lease acquired by instance ID '000000000000000000000000618D1A8C'.`\n</code></pre>\n<p>The class I'm trying to run is public and the method inside is also public, so this shouldn't be the issue. The error about binding extensions shouldn't be a problem either since I'm not using any startup code in my program. If anyone could help me with this, please respond, any feedback is appreciated.</p>\n"
