    "title": "Configure jax-ws in Glassfish not to supply client certificate in SSL handshake",
    "body": "<p>I have built a jax-ws web service client using the jaxws-maven-plugin. It is failing when I use it from a Glassfish 7.0.25 server with Java 21.</p>\n<p>I'm calling a SAP server which only validates the client certificate in the SSL handshake if one is supplied by the client. If a client certificate is not supplied then SAP allows the connection.</p>\n<p>SAP returns a CertificateRequest message during the SSL handshake, with a list of trusted certificate authorities.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Glassfish sends its self-signed certificate, which isn't signed by one of these authorities and isn't trusted, and SAP abandons the handshake. I would like it not to supply a client certificate.</p>\n<p>As part of the investigation into the problem, I wrote a web service client using jakarta.xml.soap.SOAPMessage and java.net.http.HttpClient. When I run it from the same Glassfish server, it returns 'No X.509 certificate for client authentication, use empty Certificate message instead', and the handshake is successful.</p>\n<p>Does anyone know if it is possible to configure jax-ws to not to return a client certificate during the ssl handshake?</p>\n"
