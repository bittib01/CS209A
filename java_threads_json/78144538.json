    "body": "<p>Hi I am using <a href=\"https://mise.jdx.dev/lang/java.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">mise</a> lib to manage &amp; switch between different versions of java. I ran the command</p>\n<pre><code>mise use java@adoptopenjdk-8.0.402\n</code></pre>\n<p>A file <code>.mise.toml</code> was created with the following content.</p>\n<pre><code>[tools]\njava = &quot;adoptopenjdk-8.0.402&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then I checked the java version. It still says java 17. I was expecting to see version 8.</p>\n<p>I tried equivalent commands for python. I was able to switch between v3.11 and v3.12 seamlessly.</p>\n<p>Is there any step that I am missing? TIA.</p>\n"
