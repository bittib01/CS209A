    "title": "Android status bar color property not applying for activities made from Empty Views Activity preset",
    "body": "<p>It seems that for all of my activities which I made from the preset &quot;Empty Views Activity&quot; the property <code>android:statusBarColor</code> inside of <code>themes.xml</code> is just not applied. The status bar just defaults to a white background in light mode and black in dark mode, however inside of Android Studio's activity designer I see the correct status bar color. I am using the <code>Theme.MaterialComponents.DayNight.DarkActionBar</code> parent for my theme.</p>\n<p>Could this be because I need to apply something to the activity's XML code that is automatically applied when I make activities with other presets?</p>\n"
