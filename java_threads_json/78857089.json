    "title": "Why is executing JUnit tests in IntelliJ not working as advertised?",
    "body": "<p>In IntelliJ, how can I run all of the tests in a particular class that do not have a specific tag associated with them?</p>\n<p>I am running the most recent version of IntelliJ, 2024.2 Ultimate Edition. If I create a new run configuation by selecting &quot;Edit Configurations...&quot; and then clicking the &quot;+&quot; and selecting &quot;Junit&quot; as the test type, the dialog that shows up is not at all specific to JUnit.  In Stack Overflow posts, I see that there can be a &quot;Tags&quot; option there. This is the first troubling sign. Should the dialog that appears have some JUnit specific fields?</p>\n<p>I have my tests methods annotated with <code>@Test</code>. Tests I want to exclude are also annotated with <code>@Tag(&quot;ohio&quot;)</code>. I want to run all of the tests in a particular class that don't have the specific tag &quot;ohio&quot; annotated on the method. I've tried three ways of getting this behavior by editing the &quot;Run Configuration&quot; that will be used to run the tests.  But whatever I try here doesn't work:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>I've seen some docs that indicate that there should be some options in the dialog that let me specify a tag.  But these fields don't show up for me in the dialog:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/oT3LHWFA.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/oT3LHWFA.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n</li>\n<li><p>I can select &quot;Tags&quot; instead of &quot;Class&quot;, and indicate filtering out the tags I want excluded with &quot;!ohio&quot;. But this causes all tests in all of my classes to run. The run is no longer limited to just the one class, as makes sense because this &quot;Tags&quot; option replaces the &quot;Class&quot; option in the dialog:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/oQYJtgA4.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/oQYJtgA4.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n</li>\n<li><p>I have tried adding the commmand line option <code>-DexcludeTags=ohio</code> to get the behavior I want. When I run with this option, it seems to be ignored. The tests that it should exclude still run:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/7Qhob2eK.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/7Qhob2eK.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n"
