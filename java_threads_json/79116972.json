    "title": "How to go from time zone abbreviation, such as PST, to canonical expansion for the locale",
    "body": "<p>Is there a method in the Java standard library, or in some package such as JodaTime, which can expand a time zone abbreviation such as <code>PST</code> to the full name of that time zone appropriate for the locale?  For example, <code>PST</code> can be either <code>Asia/Manila</code>, <code>America/Los_Angeles</code>, <code>America/Vancouver</code>, or many others depending on whether the user is in the Philippines, US, Canada, etc.  I know there's <code>getAvailableIDs</code> in either JDK or JodaTime, but both provide an exhaustive list and don't give any guidance on which to pick in the event the user just says <code>PST</code>.  Ideally there would be something that uses the <code>Locale</code> to pick the closest or most relevant time zone.</p>\n<p>Edit: I need to check further, but the comment below from Anonymous was the answer I was looking for.  The following code behaves as I would like:</p>\n<pre><code>    ZoneId zone = ZoneId.from(DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern(&quot;z&quot;, Locale.US).parse(&quot;MST&quot;));\n    System.out.println(zone.getId());\n\n    zone = ZoneId.from(DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern(&quot;z&quot;, Locale.CANADA).parse(&quot;MST&quot;));\n    System.out.println(zone.getId());\n</code></pre>\n<p>result:</p>\n<pre><code>America/Denver\nAmerica/Edmonton\n</code></pre>\n<p>It doesn't work perfectly, such as <code>Locale.CHINA</code> and <code>CST</code> still gives <code>America/Chicago</code> instead of a time zone in China, but this is a lot closer than having to guess when we get an ambiguous time zone as input.</p>\n"
