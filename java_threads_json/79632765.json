    "body": "<p>I need to read human-entered numbers from an excel file (typically xslx but xsl sometimes as well).</p>\n<p>Using <code>DataFormatter.formatCellValue()</code> is unsatisfactory. If the user has set numeric format with  two decimal places, I will get two decimal places, whereas I need the actual number.</p>\n<p>Using <code>getNumericCellValue()</code> does not always work either. I see cases where reading &quot;1&quot; returns &quot;0.999999999998&quot; rather than &quot;1.0&quot;. The format is General (I cannot force my users to use Number); I see &quot;1&quot; both in the cell and in the formula bar; when I save as CSV and view in Notepad, I also see exactly &quot;1&quot;. In short, I absolutely don't see where the noise comes from.</p>\n<p><code>SetCellType(STRING)</code> is deprecated.</p>\n<p>The number in question doesn't have to be integer so I cannot simply round the double value, and as the thread below illustrates, floating point numbers are also subject to noise.</p>\n<p>Thanks for any ideas!</p>\n<p>PS I've looked at similar questions, e.g. <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31205969/apache-poi-make-rounds-on-numeric-values-it-reads\">Apache POI make rounds on numeric values it reads?</a></p>\n<p>— but cannot find a satisfying answer. I am using POI version 5.4.0</p>\n"
