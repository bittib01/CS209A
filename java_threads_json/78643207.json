    "title": "Need to execute an applet installed on a remote server without using Java Web Start or any browser",
    "body": "<p><strong>Scenario:</strong></p>\n<p>My company is maintaining an applet that is used by many machines through Java Web Start.<br />\nJava Web Start is triggered by an JNLP file that contains all the informations and parameters to start the applet.<br />\nThe only thing I have access to is the JNLP file to start the applet. The applet itself and all the JARs it uses are on a remote server.</p>\n<p>Edit: I don't have access to the applet source code or JAR file. That means I can't modify it in any way and, also, I can't execute the JAR through third party software. I only have a functioning JNLP file.</p>\n<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>\n<p>The company asked me to develope a launcher to execute this applet without using Java Web Start or any kind of browser.<br />\nSince I only have the JNLP file available, is it possible to build such a launcher? And if it is possible, does someone know what should I do? I have been searching everywhere far a solutions but I couldn't find one.</p>\n"
