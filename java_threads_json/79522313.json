    "body": "<p>I have a large .xlsx file (180 MB, containing 300K lines with 150 columns each) I need to perform some operations within. I am having problems with loading this file (OutOfMemoryError), as POI has a large memory footprint on XSSF (xlsx) workbooks. I checked java.exe memory usage, it increases linearly to 17 GB and after that it becomes stale.</p>\n<p>In this line :</p>\n<pre><code>  XSSFWorkbook workbook=new XSSFWorkbook(EXCELFILEPATH)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Error:</p>\n<pre><code>Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.OutOFMemoryError: Java heap space. \n</code></pre>\n<p>Is there any other way that I can read this .xlsx excel file to memory without error?</p>\n"
