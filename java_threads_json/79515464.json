    "body": "<p>I have an attribute converter that I recently added and I want to run on all existing data.</p>\n<pre><code>Query query = entityManager.createNativeQuery(&quot;Select * from tableA&quot;, TableA.class);\nList list = query.getResultList()\nfor(Object obj : list) {\n   entityManager.persist(obj);\n}\n\n// This code is never called\npublic class Converter implements AttributeConverter{\n   @Override\n   convertToEntityAttribute(String colummn){\n      //alter the string\n   }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I noticed that this will not call my attribute converter that is defined in tableA entity on a column. However, if I modify it in anyway, it calls the attribute converter correctly on persist.</p>\n<p>I think this is because it detects it wasn't modified and to save a call to the db it doesn't actually persist it. Anybody have any ideas to mark it as persisted without altering the data? Or maybe altering the data and then setting it back?</p>\n"
