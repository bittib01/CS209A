    "body": "<p>As far as I read and heard lazy loading of a field on a detached entity is supposed to result in LazyInitializationException, but it doesn't happen.</p>\n<p>I have a User entity with a Lazy collection</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>@OneToMany(mappedBy = &quot;user&quot;, cascade = CascadeType.ALL, fetch = FetchType.LAZY)\nprivate List&lt;Vehicle&gt; vehicles;\n</code></pre>\n<p>and a Vehicle entity</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>@ManyToOne(cascade = CascadeType.ALL)\n@JoinColumn(name = &quot;rf_user_id&quot;, referencedColumnName = &quot;user_id&quot;)\nprivate User user;\n</code></pre>\n<p>I have a class which extends CommandLineRunner and inside its run method does the following</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>@Override\n@Transactional\npublic void run(String... args) {\n  User user = userRepository.findById(1L).get();\n  myService.checkContext(user);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And here what MyService.checkContext bean does</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>@Transactional(propagation = Propagation.REQUIRES_NEW)\npublic void checkContext(User_1toM user) {\n  Vehicle_Mto1 vehicle = user.getVehicles().get(0);\n}\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>As I understant, the &quot;run-method transaction&quot; has it's own persistence-context, and the &quot;checkContext-method transaction&quot; has it's own persistence-context, so I am supposed (as I understand) to get a <strong>LazyInitializationException</strong> on getting the '<em>lazy vehicle</em>' but I don't.</p>\n<p>*SQL log shows that Hibernate is doing a select to fetch Vehicle data.</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-sql prettyprint-override\"><code>select vm1_0.rf_user_id,vm1_0.vehicle_id,vm1_0.model from vehicle vm1_0 where vm1_0.rf_user_id=?*\n</code></pre>\n<p>Am I missing something? Trying to grasp Hibernate but I'm kinda very confused on that one.</p>\n<p><strong>P.S.</strong> In checkContext method I tried to do -Hibernate.isInitialized(user.getVehicles()) shows False,\nentityManager.contains(user) is also False (so it's really in Detached state)</p>\n<p><strong>P.S.S.</strong> only removing Transactional over 'run' does result in a LazyInitializationException in 'checkContext' when getting a Vehicle.</p>\n"
