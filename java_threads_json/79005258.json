    "title": "Flip bits in binary string and avoid 10 pattern",
    "body": "<p>I have a binary string with bits 0 and 1 of length n. I want to flip the bits that is turn 0 to 1 and 1 to 0 in such a way that there is no substring with 10 pattern. Find the minimum number of flips needed.</p>\n<p><strong>Example:</strong>\nInput = 10110\nOutput = 2\nExplanation: flip bits at index 0 and 4 so string becomes 00111, here there is no substring with pattern 10</p>\n<p><strong>Constraints:</strong>\nlength of string n is 1 to 3*10^5</p>\n<p>Here is my code:</p>\n<pre><code>static int solve(String s) {\n  int n = s.length();\n  int flips = 0;\n  char[] ar = s.toCharArray();\n  for(int i=0; i&lt;n-1; i++) {\n      if(ar[i] == '1' &amp;&amp; ar[i+1] == '0') {\n      flips++;\n      ar[i+1]='1'\n   }\n  }\n  return flips;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here I am checking for pattern 10, if found I am changing it to 11. But this code approach is not correct, as I need to find the minimum, so what is the correct approach to solve this problem?</p>\n"
