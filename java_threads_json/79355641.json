    "title": "GraphQL Field Naming Issue",
    "body": "<p>I'm trying to implement a GraphQL server in my Spring Boot application. I'm encountering a problem where the field names in my GraphQL schema do not match the field names in my Java entities. Here are the details:</p>\n<p>schema.graphqls</p>\n<pre><code>type Book {\n    book_id: ID!\n    title: String!\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Java Entity</p>\n<pre><code>\n@Table(name = &quot;book&quot;)\npublic class Book {\n    @Id\n    @Column(name=&quot;book_id&quot;)\n    private BigDecimal bookID;\n    private String title;\n    ....\n    // Getters and setters\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>When querying book_id in GraphQL, I get the following error because it doesn’t seem to map to bookID in the Java entity. I tried renaming the field in my entity to book_id, but that’s not a feasible long-term solution.</p>\n<pre><code>&gt; The field at path '/getAllBooks[0]/book_id' was declared as a non null\n&gt; type, but the code involved in retrieving data has wrongly returned a\n&gt; null value.  The graphql specification requires that the parent field\n&gt; be set to null, or if that is non nullable that it bubble up null to\n&gt; its parent and so on. The non-nullable type is 'ID' within parent type\n&gt; 'Book\n</code></pre>\n<p>I cant use GraphQLField from graphql-java-tools as its not available in local nexus.</p>\n<p>Is there any way to handle naming discrepancy ?</p>\n"
