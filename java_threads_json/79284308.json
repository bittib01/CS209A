    "title": "Upgrading targetSdk from 34 to 35; necessary to check entire code?",
    "body": "<p>I'm using the newest version of <code>Android Studio</code> on macOS. My app written in Java currently has <code>targetSdk = 34</code>.</p>\n<p>When I change it to <code>targetSdk = 35</code> and <code>Sync Project with Gradle Files</code> I can successfully build and run my app.</p>\n<p>But <code>targetSdk = 35</code> in <code>build.gradle.kts</code> still gives me this message:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It looks like you just edited the targetSdkVersion from 34 to 35 in\nthe editor. Be sure to consult the documentation on the behaviors that\nchange as result of this. The Android SDK Upgrade Assistant can help\nwith safely migrating.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Is this just a standard message or does it mean, there's something wrong with my code? If there're issues with my code, is there a way to make Android Studio show me the relevant code? If this is a standard message, when will it disappear?</p>\n<p>BTW: I don't understand why Google is always referring to <code>Android SDK Upgrade Assistant</code>. This isn't an assistant or tool. It has no functionality at all. This is just a documentation. Or am I missing something?</p>\n"
