    "body": "<p>I have been using <code>try-with-resources</code> a lot. I use it for database resource types or <code>File</code> stuff all the time to close the resource.</p>\n<p>Now, I am using POI for large Excel files, and I am just noticing that I should call <code>workbook.dispose()</code>. Will try-with-resources call the <code>dispose()</code> method? Everything I looked up only covers <code>close()</code>.</p>\n<p>I am not convinced that the duplicate is the same question. My question specifically asks if <code>Dispose</code> is handled by <code>try-with-resource</code>. None of the other questions mention <code>Dispose</code>.</p>\n"
