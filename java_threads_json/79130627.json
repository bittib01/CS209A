    "title": "When to use platform Threads over Virtual Threads",
    "body": "<p>Java 21 introduced the lightweight virtual threads API. Every tutorial I encountered describes them as &quot;as, or more scaleable&quot; then the common platform threads.</p>\n<p>I understand that virtual threads run on top of platform threads, but just from the user perspective I want to know if there are now any reasons left to directly use platform threads, for example for ExecutorServices.</p>\n<p>I'm not interested in opions but concrete examples like insertion in the debate between Linked- and ArrayList.</p>\n"
