    "title": "Disable Selenium Driver Manager",
    "body": "<p>With Selenium 4.11.0, selenium officially enabled selenium driver manager, that checks if driver and browser are compatible.</p>\n<p>This functionality may be arguably, but it is not part of my question. I would like to disable this behavior as my test environment is in closed network environment and with limited access to the internet. As from the documentation i did not found to which addresses an access needs to be provided, i would like to disable it.</p>\n<p>The only known address to me is visible from the warning message:\nApr 22, 2024 11:00:24 AM org.openqa.selenium.manager.SeleniumManager lambda$runCommand$1\nWARNING: Exception trying to discover geckodriver version: error sending request for url <strong>(<a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases/latest\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases/latest</a>)</strong>: error trying to connect: tcp connect error: Operation timed out (os error 110)</p>\n<p>If anyone know how can i disable it please share with me, or if you can guide me to the list of all urls that can be addressed by selenium.</p>\n"
