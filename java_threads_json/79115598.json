    "body": "<p>Everyone knows the following situation: you want to assign a variable, but have to catch an exception, and in that case assign a fallback value.</p>\n<p>This always results at least in a 6-liner, while you just want a simple fallback value and maybe don't care about the exception.</p>\n<p>How can the following be optimized in terms for reading or boilerplate code, if possible?</p>\n<pre><code>            List&lt;String&gt; mylist;\n            try {\n                mylist = readFile(resource);\n            } catch (Exception e) {\n                mylist = List.of();\n            }\n</code></pre>\n<p>I'm looking for some kind of the following (which is of course pseudocode), but to illustrate what my goal is:</p>\n<pre><code>List&lt;String&gt; mylist = if (success) ? readFile(resource) : List.of();\n</code></pre>\n"
