    "body": "<p>First, let's take a look at a very simple piece of code.</p>\n<pre><code>class S { int x = 0; } \nclass Test1 { \n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        S s = new S(); \n        System.out.println(&quot;s.x=&quot; + s.x);\n    } \n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>s.x</code> is a field access expression.</p>\n<p>The following is the relevant syntax excerpted by me from the <em>Java Language Specification</em>:</p>\n<p>15.11:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>FieldAccess:</p>\n<p>Primary . Identifier</p>\n<p>super . Identifier</p>\n<p>TypeName . super. Identifier</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>15.8: Primary:</p>\n<p>PrimaryNoNewArray</p>\n<p>ArrayCreationExpression</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>PrimaryNoNewArray:</p>\n<p>Literal</p>\n<p>ClassLiteral</p>\n<p>this TypeName . this</p>\n<p>( Expression )</p>\n<p>ClassInstanceCreationExpression</p>\n<p>FieldAccess</p>\n<p>ArrayAccess</p>\n<p>MethodInvocation</p>\n<p>MethodReference</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If only looking at the syntax excerpted above, then <code>s.x</code> seemingly does not conform to the syntax.The reason is that <code>s</code> seemingly does not belong to any member of the Primary expressions.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, the <em>specification</em> gives an explanation later, and this is exactly where my doubt lies：</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This part of the grammar of the Java programming language is unusual,\nin two ways. First, one might expect <em>simple names</em>, such as <em>names</em> of\nlocal variables and method parameters, to be primary expressions. For\ntechnical reasons, <strong>names</strong> are grouped together with primary expressions\na little later when postfix expressions are introduced (§15.14).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&quot;<strong>names</strong> are grouped together with primary expressions a little later when postfix expressions are introduced&quot;,My understanding of this sentence is that a <strong>name</strong> will become a member of the primary expressions under certain circumstances.</p>\n<p>15.14:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Postfix expressions include uses of the postfix ++ and -- operators.\n<strong>Names</strong> are not considered to be primary expressions (§15.8), but are\nhandled separately in the grammar to avoid certain ambiguities. They\nbecome interchangeable only here, at the level of precedence of\npostfix expressions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My question is:\n1.Is my above understanding correct?</p>\n<p>2.&quot;They become <strong>interchangeable</strong> only here, <strong>at the level of precedence of\npostfix expressions</strong>&quot;,\n(1).What does this sentence mean?\n(2).Can you explain, based on my example, why <code>s</code> in <code>s.x</code> becomes a member of the primary expressions here?(On the premise that my understanding is correct.)\n(3).What is the relationship between this and <strong>the level of precedence of postfix expressions</strong>?\n(4).What does &quot;<strong>interchangeable</strong>&quot; refer to?</p>\n<p>Thank you for your reading.</p>\n"
