    "title": "How does Java handle weak reference with cycle?",
    "body": "<p>Suppose I have objects A and B which strong/regular reference each others, forming a reference cycle. The path from A to the GC root is dominated by a weak reference (represented by the dashed arrow in the image below). In this case, what is the reachability of object A?</p>\n<p>Specifically, if I call <code>java.lang.ref.Cleaner.register(A, cleanup_action)</code>, is cleanup_action going to run? (the document specifies that only happens when A is <em>phantom reachable</em>)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/yrVQhoQ0.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/yrVQhoQ0.png\" alt=\"illustration of the reference graph\" /></a></p>\n"
