It merely sets the background color to black, which works as expected.</p>\n<p>Goal:</p>\n<p>Instead of a simple uniform background color, I want the background to be my brand logo, rounded, and centered on some chosen background color.</p>\n<p>Note that this is not the splashscreen. If this file was not set, then occasionally, when the app wakes up or lags, a white flash appears on the screen before the app is rendered. This file is meant to replace that white screen flash with chosen background with the brand logo centered and rounded.</p>\n"
