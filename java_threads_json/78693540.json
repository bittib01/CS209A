    "title": "Java/Kotlin Heap Size",
    "body": "<p>I'm trying to understand the space objects take up in memory in the heap when initialized, but I can't find definitive information on this, so my question is given these 2 examples, with 3 classes each, what would be the order of size taken up by each instance?\nI know every int takes up a space of 4 bytes, but does not declaring it as a val or var alter this as in class C? Does having a getter method also alter it as in class A?</p>\n<pre><code>class A (\n    val x: Int = 999,\n    val y: Int get() = 999,\n    var z: Int = -1\n)\n\nclass B (\n    val x: Int = 0,\n    val y: Int = 999,\n    val z: Int = -1\n)\n\nclass C (\n    x: Int = 999,\n    y: Int = 999,\n    z: Int = 999\n)\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this second example, does having a function declared like in A affect the size? What about in B where there will only be the class parameters called?\nHow about C where there are both parameters and getters, but also a function inside the class with its own parameters and variables?</p>\n<pre><code>class A {\n  fun foo() = 123456\n  val nr: Int get() = 7658894\n  val foo: Int get() = nr\n\n  class B(val bar: Int, val foo: Int)\n\n  class C(val bar: Int) {\n    val nr: Int get() = bar\n    fun foo() = nr\n    fun oper(num: Int): Int {\n      val x = num + 1\n      val y = num - 1\n      return x * y\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n"
