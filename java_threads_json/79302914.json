    "title": "Compile and test classes generated by Maven template engine project",
    "body": "<p>My Maven project is a template engine that generates some java classes from user input data (provided as a json file). It is simply composed of a top level module (myproject-parent, type pom) and a core module (myproject-core) containing the engine.</p>\n<p>The engine is realised thanks to the &quot;Apache FreeMarker&quot; maven dependency.</p>\n<p>The core module contains some unit tests that execute the engine and generate some classes. Now I would like to compile and import them into dedicated tests in order to check the accuracy of the generated code.</p>\n<p>Can this be done directly in the core module through a dedicated phase or goal? Or eventually in a separate test module?</p>\n<p>Ultimately, is it possible to package these generated classes with the rest of the project (as examples for user)?</p>\n"
