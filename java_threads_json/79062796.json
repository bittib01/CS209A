    "title": "Stream compressed chunks of data to SFTP server",
    "body": "<p>I'm loading batches of data from database and need to save them to a remote SFTP server using Java into a single bzip2 compressed file. I'm using JSch SFTP client. Is there any possibility to compress each batch (chunk) of data on the fly and concatenate to a resulting file? Or is it possible to use <code>BufferedInputStream</code> and to compress the buffer on every iteration and pass it to <code>put(InputStream src, String dst)</code> method of JSch? I don't want to store all the data in memory or local file because of its size. Is it possible with bzip2 format?</p>\n"
