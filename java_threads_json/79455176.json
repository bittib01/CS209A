    "title": "&quot;Err: com.android.tools.r8.internal.nc: Absent Code attribute in method that is not native or abstract&quot;, when integrating .jar files in Android Studio",
    "body": "<p>I’m working on an Android project using the SAM4S ZETA-A50 Android ECR device. I want to integrate a custom plugin with React to print a simple label saying &quot;testing&quot; when a button is clicked on the front end.</p>\n<p>The device SDK was provided by the manufacturer, and I need to use it within my project to send print commands to the device. Specifically, I'm trying to integrate the .jar file from the SDK into my Android project.</p>\n<p>I’ve included the SHC_ZETA_V1_1.jar in the libs folder and am referencing it in my build.gradle file. However, I encounter the following error when trying to compile an APK:</p>\n<pre><code>com.android.tools.r8.internal.nc: Absent Code attribute in method that is not native or abstract\n</code></pre>\n<p>This error only happens when I have the .jar file in the &quot;libs&quot; directory. If I remove the .jar file, the error doesn't occur, and the project compiles without issues.</p>\n<p>I’ve included the SHC_ZETA_V1_1.jar from the SDK in my dependencies like this:</p>\n<pre><code>repositories {\n    flatDir {\n        dirs 'libs', '../capacitor-cordova-android-plugins/src/main/libs'\n    }\n}\n\ndependencies {\n   implementation fileTree(include: ['*.jar'], dir: 'libs')\n   implementation files('libs\\\\SHC_ZETA_V1_1.jar')\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>There are no visible errors in my code, and the .jar library I'm using imports the classes correctly. However, when I try to build the APK, I encounter the error mentioned above.</p>\n"
