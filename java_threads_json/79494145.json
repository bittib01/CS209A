    "title": "Where does Up Arrow work in Java Console?",
    "body": "<p>I’m working on a program that uses <code>java.io.Console.readLine</code> to get input from the user, and to my surprise I noticed that on my Mac, it works to press <em>Up Arrow</em> to recall the previous command (like in a normal shell). It doesn’t work on any of my Linux installations, however.</p>\n<p>On the Mac, I’m running Java 23 [OpenJDK Runtime Environment Homebrew (build 23.0.1) to be exact], and the newest I have on Linux is 21 [OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 21.0.6+7-Ubuntu-122.04.1)].</p>\n<p>What I’m wondering is: <strong>Is this a difference between Java 21 and 23, or is it a macOS versus Linux difference?</strong> If it’s Mac vs Linux, I’m going to integrate GNU Readline or something into the Linux version of my code, but I’m not going to bother with that if it’s just a matter of waiting for a newer package to appear in Linux package management.</p>\n<p>By request: here is a sample program:</p>\n<pre><code>public class ConsTest {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        java.io.Console cons = System.console();\n        while (true) {\n            cons.readLine(&quot;prompt&gt; &quot;);\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Compile the program with <code>javac ConsTest.java</code> in a terminal window and then start it with <code>java ConsTest</code>. Then type <code>whatever</code> at the prompt and press Enter. Then, if you press Up Arrow, the question is if <code>whatever</code> reappears or if you just get <code>^[[A</code>.</p>\n"
