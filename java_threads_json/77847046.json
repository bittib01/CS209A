    "title": "How to update Selenium JAVA test results in Azure DevOps?",
    "body": "<p>I am working with azure devops, and using Java selenium to runs test scripts, I couldn't find a way to post my results in the test plan whether it fails or passed with screenshots.\nI already have a report generated with screenshots in the pipeline, but I want it to be updated in the test plan in each relevant manual test case.</p>\n<p>I searched and found some workarounds, first is to migrate the project and use visual basic C# as it already can be integrated with azure devops but this will be impossible to do in this project,\nOr connect my script using APIs to update the results, this seems to be more logical solution but don't know how to start.</p>\n"
