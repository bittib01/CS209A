    "body": "<p>I have code throwing a <code>reactor.core.Exceptions$RetryExhaustedException</code> and I would like to catch that specific exception.</p>\n<p>However, this <code>RetryExhaustedException</code> is not a public class, it is a package-private static class on the public reactor.core.Exceptions-class, so I cannot just put it in a catch-statement. Since the exception extends <code>IllegalStateException</code> I could catch that, but that is a very broad exception that I would prefer not to generally handle.</p>\n<p>(Note that I am <em>not</em> talking about the deprecated (public) class <code>reactor.retry.RetryExhaustedException</code>. That is not the same exception.)</p>\n"
