    "title": "How to log all Java exceptions on creation?",
    "body": "<p>In some cases exceptions being thrown are causing crashes in native library that we use before they get to be logged anywhere. So waiting for <code>UncaughtExceptionHandler</code> to log them won't work. Even exceptions that were eventually caught caused crashes in native code in a few cases. And crash logs generated have no info on these exceptions.</p>\n<p>Is there any way to log all exceptions as soon as they are created? Preferably it needs to work in a release build, without attached debugger.</p>\n"
