    "title": "Is there a way to remove a linebreak from the textToBePresentInElement waiter?",
    "body": "<p>When using the <code>innerText</code> JS method Chrome and Safari return the text in different formats if there are multiple child elements with text.\nWe've been using Safari for our tests and when calling <code>getText()</code> or <code>textToBePresentInElement(String)</code> it will return a normal linebreak which is then ignored when using the waiter. But in Chrome, the linebreak is a <code>\\n</code> which is not part of the original string, failing the check.<br />\nChrome:</p>\n<pre><code>'Beginning\\n - Ending'\n</code></pre>\n<p>Safari:</p>\n<pre><code>&quot;Beginning\n - Ending\n&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<p>I could add the <code>\\n</code> to the expected String but it wouldn't represent what we are actually waiting for to be in the element, and it would also break the Safari runs. Is there any other method that would get around this issue?</p>\n"
