    "body": "<p>Trying to generate a BPMN diagram, even a basic one with start event, end event and some service tasks from which we can call a rest api and consume the api response. Is there any Java libraries or API's available that would help me achieve this. Have searched around a lot but could not find any suitable. Any help would be appreciated.</p>\n"
