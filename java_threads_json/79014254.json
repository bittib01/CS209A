    "body": "<p>My project relies on several dependencies that transitively depend on Apache Commons Collections 3.2.2. IntelliJ warns me about <a href=\"https://devhub.checkmarx.com/cve-details/Cx78f40514-81ff/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">a CVE</a> in this library, which curiously is not visible on <a href=\"https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/commons-collections/commons-collections/3.2.2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">maven repository</a>. For example <a href=\"https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/commons-beanutils/commons-beanutils/1.9.4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Apache Commons BeanUtils 1.9.4</a>, despite being on the last available version still uses that old version of commons-collections, which apparently has this annoying CVE. And a LOT of librairies use beanutils</p>\n<p>Now, if I want to get rid of this CVE, how to proceed? I already pushed every dependency I could to the last available one and even used DependenciesManagement to handle the versions of transitive dependencies. But as for commons-collections, they changed their pakcages to commons-collections4 starting with the 4.0 version so it is quite troublesome to exclude/update dependencies in this case.</p>\n<p>Maybe bridging proxy from commons-collections to commons-collections4 would do the trick. I can't think of anything else what do you think?</p>\n"
