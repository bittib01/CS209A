    "body": "<p>I created the tables Person, PersonExtra, PersonBasic, etc. in my database with the superclass Person and subclasses PersonExtra and PersonBasic.</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>@Entity\n@Table(name = &quot;person&quot;)\n@Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceType.JOINED)\npublic class Person {\n    @Id\n    @Column(name = &quot;id&quot;, nullable = false, unique = true, length = 20)\n    private String id;\n    private String name;\n    private String lastname;\n    // ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>@Entity\n@PrimaryKeyJoinColumn(name = &quot;extra_id&quot;)\npublic class PersonExtra extends Person {\n    private String code;\n    private String subject;\n    // ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>@Entity\n@PrimaryKeyJoinColumn(name = &quot;basic_id&quot;)\npublic class PersonBasic extends Person {\n    private String range;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>If I create a Person first and then try to create a PersonExtra with an existing Person's ID, I get a duplicate ID error because it tries to persist both Person and PersonExtra. It seems like a person can only have one unique type and can only be created through the subclass.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I would like a person to be able to be both a PersonExtra and a PersonBasic at the same time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When I was modeling the database, it seemed better. I had the idea of using something like inheritance in the database, which could be easier to map.</p>\n<p>How can I structure my JPA entities so different subclasses (PersonExtra and PersonBasic) can be created with the same id as the superclass (Person)?</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>I was thinking that maybe creating One to One relations like Person with PersonExtra and Person with PersonBasic could work.<br />\nI liked the idea of having inheritance here but, seems is it not possible in this situation?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>I was considering using the MappedSuperclass annotation, but isn't that just for an abstract class when the entity isn't created in the database?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Or maybe should I modify the database and create a one-to-many relationship with roles? Part of me thinks that some of the database semantics could be lost, and implementing the logic later could be complicated.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'm new to this and could be wrong about all of this.</p>\n"
