    "title": "Request delays (15-20 sec every 8-10 request): Dockerized java Spring Boot Project with PostgreSQL (14)",
    "body": "<p>I have a project using spring boot(2.5.5) + postgresql (14). The issue is as follows: when I make a request to an endpoint (which involves complex database queries with a large number of joins), every 8-10 requests experience a delay of 15-20 seconds. This occurs when the project and the database are running in Docker containers. However, when deployed locally without containers, there is no such issue, and requests always complete within 300-600 milliseconds. Can you suggest what might be causing the problem, with every 8-10 requests experiencing a delay of 15-20 seconds?</p>\n<p>Optimized queries using entity graphs and other tools. But the problem is not related with query optimization. It is about load boarders in postgresql inside docker container.</p>\n"
