    "title": "Persistent Atomic Counter in multi-threaded environment",
    "body": "<p>I want to write a data in the file with first field at incremental counter which should start from 1 after reaching 25k.\nMultiple threads are writing in the file concurrently.</p>\n<p>I need to persist this counter because if process get restarted then it counter should start from last count.</p>\n<p>My thinking :\nI am thinking to use INCR in Redis. It will increment the value and give incremental number. In multi-threaded env also since redis is single threaded so this will be thread safe. I hope there wont be a case when any number shall be skipped or give duplicate value to thread.\nIf we use this approach then how to reset this key when value reaches to 25k in a thread safe way.  Please suggest.</p>\n<p>If there is any other approach, please suggest that as well.</p>\n"
