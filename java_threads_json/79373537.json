    "title": "Finding all rows where a jsonb field filled with an array has the same element at the first position",
    "body": "<p>Essentially, I have a table in my database, where one column has the type jsonb. This column is filled with an list of IDs, with which a branch in a tree structure is described.</p>\n<p>What I want to do is to select all rows, where the first element of that list is the same as an input parameter.</p>\n<p>My first approach was to use <code>createNativeQuery()</code>, but circumstances demand that the <code>select</code> is made with a JPA query using <code>createQuery()</code>.</p>\n<p>My sql query reads like <code>select * from my_table where (jsonb_field -&gt;&gt; 0)::bigint = ?</code>, how would I be able to achieve the same effect with a JPA query?</p>\n"
