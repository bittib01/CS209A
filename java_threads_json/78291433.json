    "body": "<p>I am using Spring boot and JPA repository for my application For database i am using PostgreSQL database.</p>\n<p>I have crores of data in my table employee.\nDue to performance issue i have implemented database partition on employee table with partition column of company_id.</p>\n<p>so whenever i perform any database query on employee table i always pass the company_id condition for the batter performance.</p>\n<p>now the question is that when i perform any changes in employee record i always use Save method of JPA repository. The save method internally create the native SQL query for update the record but it update the row by only emp_id (PK). Due to this the performance again goes down because we do not have company_id check in where condition.</p>\n<p>Now i want to add Company_id check in entity update operation for the batter performance how should i achieve this.</p>\n<p>Please let me know if any additional information is required.</p>\n<p>Please guide. Thanks</p>\n"
