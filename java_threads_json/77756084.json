    "title": "Issue while upgrading from JDK 11 to JDK 17 with oracle driver ojdbc8",
    "body": "<p>I am currently working on upgrading from JDK 11 to JDK 17. However, I encountered an issue with the Oracle driver, specifically the ojdbc8 driver we are using. After researching, I learned that ojdbc8 only supports JDK 8 and JDK 11, while the ojdbc11 driver is designed for JDK 11, JDK 17, and onwards. Additionally, the ojdbc11 driver is compatible only with Oracle Database versions 21 and 23, whereas we are currently using Oracle 19c.</p>\n<p>I am seeking information on whether there is any workaround or solution to continue using the ojdbc8 Oracle driver with JDK 17?</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance.</p>\n<p>Any workaround or solution if available?</p>\n"
