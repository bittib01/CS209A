    "title": "STIGViewer 2.18 will not open",
    "body": "<p>Hey guys I am new to STIGViewer on MAC to the best of my knowledge I have installed everything correctly for Java, JDK, JavaFX, you name it. I am very familiar with STIG on windows devices but I am not for MAC. I can't get STIGViewer to open at all and I honestly do not know where the issue is. I have followed several instructions however, they could be a little outdated. I have tried to uninstall everything and reinstall it, maybe I am not understanding the simple things. I am also not a MAC user.</p>\n<p>When I try to open it from the folder I choose open with Java and nothing. I have also tried opening it from terminal and this is what I get.</p>\n<p>java -jar STIGViewer-2.18.jar\nError: Unable to access jarfile STIGViewer-2.18.jar</p>\n<p>this is my current java version:</p>\n<p>java --version\njava 23.0.1 2024-10-15\nJava(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 23.0.1+11-39)\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 23.0.1+11-39, mixed mode, sharing)</p>\n<p>I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling, starting from scratch, still the same issue.</p>\n"
