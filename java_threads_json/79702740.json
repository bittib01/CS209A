    "title": "Tomcat 9 change in retrieving MIME type of a resource?",
    "body": "<p>Recently did an upgrade from Tomcat 9.0.90 to 9.0.107, and we observed a difference in how Tomcat determines a MIME type for a resource, where it appears that if a web application defines any MIME mappings in its web.xml, then the server-level web.xml is complete ignored.</p>\n<p>For example, take the following code:</p>\n<pre><code>String mimeType = getServletConfig().\n                    getServletContext().getMimeType(resource.getPath());\n</code></pre>\n<p>In our specific case, the resource was to a .txt file.  In Tomcat 9.0.90, the API call returns &quot;text/plain&quot; (Good!).  In Tomcat 9.0.107, it returns <code>null</code> (Bad!) (where our servlet code falls back to &quot;application/octet-stream&quot;).</p>\n<p>What I noticed is that the MIME mapping for 'txt' is specified in the Tomcat conf/web.xml file we use, but it is not defined in the web application's web.xml file.  When I add the mapping to the webapps' web.xml, the API call returns &quot;text/plain&quot;.</p>\n<p>I examined the Change Log for Tomcat 9.0.107, and I could not find anything that explicitly mentions this change in behavior.  If a webapp defines any MIME mappings in its web.xml, must it define a mapping for <strong>everything</strong> now?  Is this standard servlet application behavior?  Or is this a bug in Tomcat?</p>\n"
