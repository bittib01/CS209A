    "body": "<p>I'm tasked with writing a file into our S3 bucket from java.</p>\n<p>I have set up the IAM role. I have a certificate, a private key, a trust-anchor-arn, a profile-arn, and a role-arn.</p>\n<p>I can then make an S3Client using a ProcessCredentialsProvider that calls out to aws_signing_helper, which returns json that includes fields for AccessKeyId, SessionToken, etc.  <strong>This works</strong>.</p>\n<p>I do not want to call out to an external process. There doesn't seem to be a way using pure java to make the API calls.</p>\n<p>Is it possible to get the credentials without calling out to an external program?  If so, how?</p>\n"
