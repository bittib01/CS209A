    "title": "How do I disable ImageSmoothing in javaFX 3D",
    "body": "<p>I'm rendering cubes in JavaFX 3D for a voxel-based game. I'm trying to texture the cubes with a diffuseMap, however due to the textures being 32x32 the image is being considerably blurred. Is there a way to turn this off?</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>//render materials\nImage tileSet = new Image(&quot;Graphics/tileSet2.png&quot;, 0, 0, false, false, false);\n\ntileMaterial = new PhongMaterial();\ntileMaterial.setDiffuseMap(tileSet);\n</code></pre>\n<p>As you can see in the code above, I've tried turning off blurring and mipmapping, but it doesn't change anything. I did however try resizing the image to be 1024x1024 and it worked, but it had a more significant drain on performance, and you could still see gaps around the edges of each texture.</p>\n"
