    "title": "Is there a way to access the preinitialized solution by using the timefold SolverManager?",
    "body": "<p>I'm trying to develop a small planning application with timefold.ai. As it grew, the Construction Phase takes more und more time. I embedded TimeFold into a Spring Boot application and I am using this code to run the solver async in background:</p>\n<pre><code>this.solverJob = solverManager.solveBuilder()\n                .withProblemId(currentSolution.getId())\n                .withProblemFinder(jobId -&gt; currentSolution)\n                .withBestSolutionConsumer(solution -&gt; {\n                    this.currentSolution = solution;\n                } )\n                .withExceptionHandler((jobId, exception) -&gt; {\n                    log.error(&quot;Failed solving jobId ({}).&quot;, jobId, exception);\n                })\n                .run();\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>BestSolutionConsumer</code> is only invoked after the construction phase has completed. Therefore, during the construction phase, which takes approximately 5-10 minutes for my current problem sizes, I am unable to provide progress updates to the user. Is it possible to access the <code>currentSolution</code> while it is being initialized?</p>\n<p>I also tried the <code>solveAndListen</code> method of the <code>SolverManger</code>, but it also only triggers the change event after the construction phase has finished.</p>\n"
