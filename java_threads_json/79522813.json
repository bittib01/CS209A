    "body": "<p>When running tests on my java project in vscode I would get a pop-up warning saying &quot;build failed&quot; and giving me options to continue, always continue, or fix. I accidentally clicked always continue so the pop-up doesn't show anymore. I want to make the pop-up come back.</p>\n<p>I have tried the solution at <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76202255/how-can-i-reenable-the-warning-about-unsupported-python-version-by-vs-code-debug/76206135#76206135\">How can I reenable the warning about unsupported Python version by VS Code debugger</a> but I couldn't find the setting I needed. I also tried completly uninstalling and reinstalling vscode following the instructions here <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52461400/how-to-completely-remove-vs-code-setting/52462074#52462074\">how to completely remove vs-code setting?</a>. The latter did restore a bunch of other pop-ups but not the build failed pop-up I want.</p>\n<p>I am using gradle version 8.8 and the debugger for java by microsoft</p>\n"
