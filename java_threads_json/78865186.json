    "body": "<p>I am trying to use magicdraw's built-in opacity language to draw 3d scatterplots, while I don't want to use matlab language. However I am not familiar with java at all. I am trying to place the jmathlib.jar file in the lib folder of magicdraw and introduce a code in the opacity behavior.</p>\n<pre><code>import org.math.plot.*\nimport javax.swing.JFrame\n\nclass ScatterPlot3DExample {\n    static void main(String[] args) {\n        Plot3DPanel plot = new Plot3DPanel()\n        double[] x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] as double[]\n        double[] y = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] as double[]\n        double[] z = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] as double[]\n\n        plot.addScatterPlot(&quot;3D Scatter Plot&quot;, x, y, z)\n        plot.setAxisLabel(0, &quot;X Axis&quot;)\n        plot.setAxisLabel(1, &quot;Y Axis&quot;)\n        plot.setAxisLabel(2, &quot;Z Axis&quot;)\n\n        JFrame frame = new JFrame(&quot;3D Scatter Plot Example&quot;)\n        frame.setContentPane(plot)\n        frame.setSize(600, 600)\n        frame.setVisible(true)\n        frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE)\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>An error will then be displayed.I'm not sure exactly what the problem is, because import doesn't show an error.</p>\n<pre><code>00:00:00,691 ERROR: Cannot evaluate Opaque Action: org.codehaus.groovy.control.MultipleCompilationErrorsException: startup failed: Script13.groovy: 6: unable to resolve class Plot3DPanel @ line 6, column 21.

I found some related files in the lib folder, such as jide-charts-3.7.12.jar. So I'm wondering if I'm missing some steps.</p>\n<p>I've tried using JavaScript before, but it seems that the built-in nashorn and rhino don't work with projects in github. Anyway, I'm simply trying to plot the results from other behavioral operations in the sysml activity graph into a 3d scatterplot without using matlab as much as possible. I'd appreciate any help you can provide.</p>\n"
