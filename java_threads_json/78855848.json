    "title": "React native not build - Java importing root project - 70% Evaluate Settings",
    "body": "<p>I'm working on a project in react native, suddenly opening visual studio code I see from the bottom bar that the java project is not built, remaining stuck at the <code>Java importing root project - 70% Evaluate Settings</code> phase. Obviously if I execute <code>npm run android</code>, on emulator or device, the app is not built.\nI can't understand at all what the problem could come from, especially because it worked before.\nI have the environment configured correctly, with environment variables, SDK etc.. since I was already working there.\nCan you tell me what this problem comes from?</p>\n<p>I updated the java version and checked for errors in native android files and found no errors.</p>\n"
