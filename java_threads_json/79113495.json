    "title": "Add additional Java libraries to the spring boot container",
    "body": "<p>Since some libraries contain licenses that do not allow distribution, customers who want to run our software must get the libraries by themselves and add these to the spring boot application.</p>\n<p>Previously, we added the spring boot uber jar to a container and used the <code>PropertiesLauncher</code> and the <code>LOADER_PATH</code> so that the customer can mount the library in the container and adapt the classpath.</p>\n<p>Now that we want to switch for the image generation to buildpack, just like <code>mvn spring-boot:build-image</code> would do. As the application is unpacked in the image, it seems to me that the <code>PropertiesLauncher</code> and <code>LOADER_PATH</code> would no longer work.</p>\n<p>What is the recommended way to add third party Java libraries to a buildback-built spring boot container?</p>\n"
