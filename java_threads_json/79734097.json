While this looked very peculiar to me, I couldn't find any documentation of whether the <code>File</code> class is meant to be overridden.</p>\n<p>Note that the class is not <code>final</code>, at least not explicitly <em>preventing</em> developers from overriding the class.</p>\n<p>Is there any official Javadoc or JEP providing information of whether this class was designed to be overridden? If yes, where?</p>\n"
