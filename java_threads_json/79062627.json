    "title": "Is there a jdbc-driver to fetch DB credentials from Azure-Key-Vault?",
    "body": "<p>AWS has a library that provides wrappers for common jdbc drivers that you can specify while configuring a DataSource resource (in server.xml say) and introduce zero code changes. I'm specifically referring to this aws library: <a href=\"https://github.com/aws/aws-secretsmanager-jdbc\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">aws-secretsmanager-jdbc</a>. At application runtime (specifically when a connection is requested) the wrapper driver dynamically fetches username/password from AWS Secrets Manager and injects it into the DataSource.</p>\n<p>Is there a similar wrapper driver I can use in Azure deployments? That, at connection time fetches username/password from Azure Key Vault?</p>\n<p>I'm trying to deploy the same application to Azure that I already have on AWS and <strong>ideally I would specify the Azure equivalent of aws-secretsmanager-jdbc wrapper driver in a config file and everything would work without any code changes to my application.</strong> If such a library does not exist for Azure, I will have to modify application code to deal with API calls to AKV and so on (is my understanding).</p>\n<p>My search* didn't yield results I was looking for. Just before I give up, thought to check if others have figured out a solution in a different way??</p>\n<ul>\n<li>*I have googled 'azure key vault jdbc library' and looked at the top 10 or so hits.</li>\n</ul>\n"
