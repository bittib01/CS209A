    "title": "Implementation of interface from library does not work - what am i missing?",
    "body": "<p>I have been struggling with this for quite some time now:</p>\n<p>I am trying to write a rather small Android app in Kotlin. Its purpose is to receive Data from a Bluetooth device. The vendor of the device has made an Android API for that purpose. The idea of the API is the following:</p>\n<p>After establishing a connection and starting data acquisition, the device sends the data back to the Android device. Then, the third party library (API) is supposed to call a method, which can be implemented into a class via an interface.</p>\n<p>I got everything to the point where the connection works and the data acquisition runs. I also know from the log that the Android device receives data, but <strong>the functions that I have implemented over the interface do not get called</strong>.</p>\n<p>I implemented the interface like so:</p>\n<pre><code>@SuppressLint(&quot;MissingPermission&quot;)\nclass AndroidBluetoothController(\n    private val context: Context\n) : BluetoothController, OnDataAvailable {\n</code></pre>\n<p>Android Studio automatically added the implemented functions for me and I implemented them as well:</p>\n<pre><code>override fun onDataAvailable(frame: Parcelable?) {\n    Log.i(&quot;FRAME&quot;,frame.toString())\n}\noverride fun onDataLost(p0: String?, p1: Int) {\n    Log.e(&quot;onDataLost&quot;, p0.toString()+&quot;-&gt;&quot;+p1.toString())\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The API seems to work in general, as all other functionalities of it are available, but nothing appears in the logs.</p>\n<p>By now, I am out of ideas. Could it be an issue with DI? I am using Dagger-Hilt.</p>\n<p>The AndroidBluetoothController is injected like so:</p>\n<pre><code>@Module\n@InstallIn(SingletonComponent::class)\nobject AppModule {\n\n    @Provides\n    @Singleton\n    fun provideBluetoothController(@ApplicationContext context: Context): BluetoothController {\n        return AndroidBluetoothController(context)\n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And then it is called in the Viewmodel:</p>\n<pre><code>    @HiltViewModel\nclass BluetoothViewModel @Inject constructor(\n    private val bluetoothController: BluetoothController\n) : ViewModel() {\n</code></pre>\n"
