    "title": "Spring Bean hierarchy of objects based on tenant/region",
    "body": "<p>I have a spring webapp. Here's a simple structure to explain my problem</p>\n<pre><code>java/\n└── com/\n    └── example/\n        ├── controller/\n        │   └── MyController.java       // REST Controller\n        ├── service/\n        │   └── MyService.java          // Service interface\n        ├── client/\n        │   └── EC2Client.java          // EC2Client\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>MyController</code> injects <code>MyService</code> and <code>MyService</code> injects <code>EC2Client</code>.<br />\nThere are multiple Beans of EC2Client. These are used as per the region. Region is received through the rest API in controller.</p>\n<p>I would like to create bean hierarchy based on regions(us-east, us-west, etc). So for each region, I should have a controller, service, and a ec2client bean.</p>\n<p>Ideally if I had to create a single class bean based on region I could create quailifier beans. But how do I do this for the whole heirarchy. I could potentially have 5+ regions So, want to make this dynamic in nature</p>\n"
