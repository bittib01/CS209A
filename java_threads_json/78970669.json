    "title": "Impact of high CPU usage on a background thread execution in Java",
    "body": "<h3>Context</h3>\n<p>There are many ways of creating a &quot;background thread&quot; in Java. I want to spin off exactly one thread that keeps running in the background. I'm using <code>ScheduledExecutorService</code> for this.</p>\n<p>I want that thread to run at a fixed interval of 2 seconds (between consecutive executions). This thread makes a network call to a service with a total timeout of 1 second.</p>\n<p>As I understand, specifying a priority to a thread is an OS dependent behavior and is merely a suggestion to the OS to prioritize that thread over other threads in the system.</p>\n<h3>Question</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><p>What is the guarantee that my thread will continue executing at a regular interval (at least once every 3 seconds) despite the CPU usage shooting up (say &gt;= 70%) ?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strike>Is there a way of guaranteeing this? Is this a platform dependent question?</strike> Removing this to make this Q more focused on the essentials.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Update: Clarification</h3>\n<p>Some details about the background thread's characteristics:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The majority of the thread's time will be spent in performing a blocking REST API call using JAX-RS with JerseyClient's implementation.</li>\n<li>The remaining time is spent in doing cheap processing work that involves processing a JSON response of &lt; 1 KB and updating an in-memory HashMap.</li>\n<li>This thread will be running in a Web app processing requests in an AWS ECS cluster (auto-scaling enabled) - and we <em>wouldn't want</em> the CPU to go beyond 70%. It will only shoot up beyond 70% due to an unexpected spike which is extremely rare.</li>\n<li>If the thread gets delayed beyond 3 seconds once in ~1000 times (works 99.9% times), it should be okay. So I don't need it to be real-time (100%).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Also, when I mentioned 70% CPU, I meant 70% of the overall compute capacity available to the application (including cores etc).</p>\n"
