    "title": "Wrong Android UI elements found after rotating phone when Biometric prompt is active",
    "body": "<p>I am trying to deal with this new Landscape requirement nonsense. I also have this problem is also with a more complicated fragment but I noticed it happens with this as well and it is much easier to describe and recreate.</p>\n<p>If the phone is rotated while the system biometric prompt is active, once the authentication succeeds, the UI cannot be updated from the onAuthenticationSucceeded callback.</p>\n<p>The test is very simple, a text view, one button to show the prompt, and one button to change the text as a control. In the onAuthenticationSucceeded callback, it also changes the text.</p>\n<p>Test 1: Show the prompt and authenticate. Result: Text changes.\nTest 2: Show the prompt, rotate phone, and then authenticate. Result: The text does not change (but it does try).</p>\n<p>Looking at the text view's instance ID (by just printing the element) before doing anything, it is d8fe4ae, when it tries to update the text in either test, the ID is still d8fe4ae. After test 1 if I manually change the text, the ID is still d8fe4ae.\nHowever, if after test 2 I manually change the text, the ID is now 4200ade.</p>\n<p>So after rotation, the original text view no longer exists and has been recreated, however, the process that was active at the time does not have access to the newly created view instance and is still looking for the old one.</p>\n<p>I have tried explicitly running both with runOnUiThread, and not storing any reference to any of the view or anything else and using findViewByID every time.</p>\n"
