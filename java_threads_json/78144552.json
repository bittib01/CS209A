    "body": "<p>I'm new with Docker, I'm study and learning....So.....sorry for the bad code. I'm trying to generate the jar when I'm building my docker image; I would like to use a basic image of openjdk and use gradlew (gradle-wrapper) to do the clean and build but I'm having problems with gradlew.</p>\n<p>Currently I have this code:</p>\n<pre><code>FROM openjdk:17.0.2\nLABEL authors=&quot;ivanh&quot;\nWORKDIR /app\nCOPY ./ .\nRUN ./gradlew clean build\nENTRYPOINT [&quot;ls&quot;]\nEXPOSE 8001\n</code></pre>\n<p>when I run <code>docker build -t citas .</code> I have this problem</p>\n<pre><code>------\n &gt; [4/4] RUN ./gradlew clean build:\n0.390\n0.390 xargs is not available\n0.390\n------\nDockerfile:5\n--------------------\n   3 |     WORKDIR /app\n   4 |     COPY ./ .\n   5 | &gt;&gt;&gt; RUN ./gradlew clean build\n   6 |     ENTRYPOINT [&quot;ls&quot;]\n   7 |     EXPOSE 8001\n--------------------\nERROR: failed to solve: process &quot;/bin/sh -c ./gradlew clean build&quot; did not complete successfully: exit code: 1\n</code></pre>\n<p>I'm search about that and ask to the IA. I found that one solution is change openjdk image and another solution is add this command <code>RUN microdnf install findutils</code> but with the last solutions the time is very slow while download and install the util.</p>\n<p>I'm confused because I think the purpose of gradle-wrapper is run commands without have gradle installed. Can someone clarify this for me ? If the only solution is change the openjdk image, can you recomend me one?</p>\n"
