    "title": "How to store user data for every WebSocket connection in Helidon SE4",
    "body": "<p><strong>Task</strong>: There is a server implemented using the Helidon SE4. I need to store user data associated with each WebSocket connection on the server side.</p>\n<p><strong>Problem</strong>: Unlike Jakarta WebSockets, Helidon SE 4 does not provide any mechanisms for this. <code>WsSession</code> does not have methods like <code>Session.getUserProperties()</code>, and the class implementing <code>WsListener</code> is reused for all connections established.</p>\n<p><strong>What I tried to do</strong>: But each WebSocket connection is provided with its own unique virtual thread.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I tried using <code>ThreadLocal</code> to store user data. However, this leads to memory leaks because the client can close the connection without notifying the server. As a result, none of the <code>WsListener</code> methods will ever be called from the desired thread, making it impossible to call <code>ThreadLocal.remove()</code> from the desired thread.</li>\n<li>I also tried using <code>ConcurrentHashMap</code>. But this caused performance problems because all threads responsible for the connection are forced to constantly wait for each other.</li>\n</ol>\n"
