    "title": "How to create a complex entity without save, in Hibernate 6.6?",
    "body": "<p>I want to create a &quot;preview&quot; object and want to return the object to a rest entpoint. (String Json)</p>\n<p>In Hibernate 6.3 I had no problems but in 6.6 I got the error message:</p>\n<pre><code>org.hibernate.TransientObjectException: persistent instance references an unsaved transient instance of 'XXX' (save the transient instance before flushing)\n</code></pre>\n<p>I add <code>cascade = {CascadeType.PERSIST}</code> that helps in Hibernate 6.3 but not in 6.6.</p>\n<p>The error message comes in a for-loop. The first run works, the error only occurs on the second run.</p>\n<p>What can I do?</p>\n<p>EDIT:\nI was able to narrow down the problem. I create object A, set a few properties and then go into the FOR loop and create object B. I attach object B to a list property of object A with <code>ObjectA.getList().add(ObjectB)</code>. The loop should run through X times. The error occurs exactly on the second run.</p>\n<p>The error occurs when I access a repository in the for loop and call a select (<code>findByName()</code>) to get more information for the ObjectB and set properties accordingly. Obviously Hibernate does not like that I call a repository / select without having saved the object before. Do I have to somehow annotate the repository method to be ReadOnly or something?</p>\n<p>EDIT 2:\nI have now rebuilt my code so that I first read out all the necessary data and then create the object. Which then goes into performance, but I can't get it to run any other way. Unfortunately, my tests are now failing! Exactly the same thing happens. I create the object in the test without saving! And I want to test exactly that, with <code>objectARepo.findAll().size() = 0</code>. Again, I get the same error message. I have also tried <code>objectARepo.detach(objectA)</code> and <code>objectARepo.flush()</code>. Although the error then comes with <code>objectARepo.flush()</code>.</p>\n"
