    "title": "Simplified outer convex hull of a set of points using JTS",
    "body": "<p>I'd like to use <a href=\"https://github.com/locationtech/jts\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">JTS</a> to calculate a simplified (fewer points) convex hull from a collection of points including inner and perimeter points, where the hull is allowed to be a bit larger in area in order to simplify, but must contain all of the points.  I think that <a href=\"https://locationtech.github.io/jts/javadoc/org/locationtech/jts/simplify/PolygonHullSimplifier.html#hullByAreaDelta-org.locationtech.jts.geom.Geometry-boolean-double-\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">PolygonHullSimplifier.hullByAreaDelta</a> is designed for that.</p>\n<p>Code snippet here (same data as plots but in different units.) <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/joshgold22/11d39c85456271109b2421dd124be241\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://gist.github.com/joshgold22/11d39c85456271109b2421dd124be241</a></p>\n<p>I tried creating a MultiPoint, calling convexHull() on it, and passing that to <code>PolygonHullSimplifier.hullByAreaDelta(hull, true /*outer*/, 0.1 /*areaDeltaRatio*/)</code></p>\n<p>There were two surprises for me.  First, convexHull didn't seem to return a convexHull, though it did remove many points.  Showing the original set and then the result of <code>convexHull()</code>:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/yk5N8yX0.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/yk5N8yX0.png\" alt=\"plot of all points\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/CbmmuAvr.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/CbmmuAvr.png\" alt=\"plot of convexHull result, but not convex\" /></a></p>\n<p>Second, no matter how I play with the <code>areaDeltaRatio</code>, the result of <code>hullByAreaDelta</code> was always identical to the basic (intermediate) convex hull Polygon.  (It did differ when I tried an inner hull.)</p>\n<p>I'll add one more picture, of a DouglasPeuckerSimplifier simplification, which does work, but which I understand would not be guaranteed to contain all of the original points.</p>\n<p>Can you help clarify what I'm misunderstanding and show me how to do this?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/vTO7PyNo.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/vTO7PyNo.png\" alt=\"Douglas Peucker simplification\" /></a></p>\n"
