    "body": "<p>I'm trying to ensure that my JUnit test method doesn't open any outbound <code>Socket</code>, mostly in order to be sure that it's a unit test, not an integration one. If it tries to open a socket, an exception should be raised. How can I do this (maybe with the help of an existing library)?</p>\n"
