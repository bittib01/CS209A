    "title": "Mark toggle as deprecated after specific date",
    "body": "<p>At my company we're developing trunk based and use feature toggles to control sleeping code. The toggles are basically enums and the start arguments of the application are mapped to the toggles so that only the given ones are active. Toggles are activated at specific dates, like e.g. <code>01.10.2025</code>.</p>\n<p>I would like to declare this date in a property or annotation on the enum value and show a warning in the IDE (Intellij) when the date is exceeded so you see quickly when you can delete old code.</p>\n<p>Is there a library for this or is there a better approach to tackle this situation?</p>\n"
