    "title": "Kafka reactor response",
    "body": "<p>My team is developing a chat application that uses Kafka Reactor for the transamition of data between the clients.</p>\n<p>One of our problems is the return of feedback to the users. By calling an API like ex. &quot;/registerUser&quot; one would expect to recieve a feedback of whether the registration process has been successfull or not from the same endpoint without having to than call another one to find out the result, which is how kafka seems to handle things.</p>\n<p>I'm new to working with kafka and just started bashing my head against it. Am I trying to do something that isn't possible or I'm looking at this wrong?</p>\n"
