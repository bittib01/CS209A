    "title": "JFR not dumping file contents",
    "body": "<p>I am trying to have my process run with JFR enabled. Recently, when the process ends, contents are not dumped to the JFR file, so it’s just empty. If I run the process for maybe 3 minutes and stop it, the file gets written to. But I need it to run for a big longer. I set the max size of the file to 4G and cleared a bunch of space on the host. Is there any reason why the JFR file would only be written to sometimes, not every time?</p>\n<p>Ive tried Increasing maxsize, increasing heap allocated to process, cleared space on disk</p>\n"
