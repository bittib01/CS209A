    "body": "<p>My case is as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I have several test classes to run</li>\n<li>I want most of them all to run in parallel, and all tests inside to run in parallel too</li>\n<li>I want one specific test class to run isolated from the others, but tests in them to run in parallel too</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Using JUnit5, my junit-platform.properties are:</p>\n<pre><code>junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.enabled=true\njunit.jupiter.execution.parallel.mode.default=concurrent\njunit.jupiter.execution.parallel.mode.classes.default=concurrent\n</code></pre>\n<p>My first approach was to annotate test class I wanted to be separated with <code>@Isolated</code>, but doing that resulted in all tests inside this class to be run sequentially too, which I need to avoid, because those tests are long-running</p>\n<p>What could be the other way to achieve this partial sequentiality?</p>\n"
