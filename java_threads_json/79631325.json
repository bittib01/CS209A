    "body": "<p>I have a table with composite key:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-sql prettyprint-override\"><code>create table profile\n(\n    id      int,\n    zone    text,\n    data    blob,\n    primary key ((id, zone))\n);\n</code></pre>\n<p>And a use case where I need to select many records given a list of (id, zone).\nI tried to do<br />\n<code>SELECT data FROM profile WHERE (id, zone) IN ?</code> and then supply it with a <code>List&lt;TupleValue&gt;</code> but Cassandra won't let me do it for <code>Multi-column relations can only be applied to clustering columns but was applied to: id</code>.<br />\nI don't really want to do multiple<br />\n<code>SELECT data FROM profile WHERE id = ? and zone = ?</code> given the large number of records, so wondering if there's a better way doing it.</p>\n"
