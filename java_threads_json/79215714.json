    "body": "<p>I have an entity that looks like this</p>\n<pre><code>@Entity\n@IdClass(AId.class)\nclass A {\n    \n   @Id\n   private String userName\n    \n   @Id\n   @NotNull\n   @JoinColumn(name = &quot;location_id&quot;, referenceColumnName = &quot;id&quot;, nullable=false, foreignKey = @ForeignKey(name = ...))\n   private Location location;\n   \n   private String userInformation;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The class Location looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code>@Entity\nclass Location {\n\n   @NotNull\n   private Long id;\n\n   @NotNull\n   @Column(nullable = false}\n   private String name;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And then I have a class to define the Id</p>\n<pre><code>class AId implements Serializable {\n  private Long locationId;\n  private String userName;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now, I do some manipulation on the object of class A and then want to store it. However, I get an exception that tells me that the non-nullable field Location#name that is reference by an object of A is null. I debugged through it and made sure that the field is actually not null. However, I still get this. What's the issue? The location that A is referring to is already persisted on the database.</p>\n"
