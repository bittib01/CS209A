    "body": "<p>I am wondering how efficiently handle startup parameters. So far I used to do it in my <code>public static void main(String[] args)</code> method and taking it from there.</p>\n<p>Now I want to combine both Java Batch and CDI through JBeret and Weld. While JBeret does not impose how I trigger a job, Weld gives me the idea to handle application configuration in an <code>@ApplicationScoped</code> bean. From the documentation this should be possible: <a href=\"https://docs.jboss.org/weld/reference/latest/en-US/html_single/#cdi_se_module\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Weld should inject command line arguments</a>.</p>\n<p>Apparently this does not work. Or only works if at the same time the next chapter is followed as well: <a href=\"https://docs.jboss.org/weld/reference/latest/en-US/html_single/#_bootstrapping_cdi_se\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bootstrapping CDI SE</a></p>\n<p>But as soon as my replace my main class with Weld's main class I can no longer setup JBeret - and it feels odd to do it in the event handler.</p>\n<p>What other options exist to start the batch job, or how can I keep my own main method yet have command line parameters injected into the bean? How do others handle runtime configuration? Any ideas or hints welcome.</p>\n<p><strong>Update:</strong>\nI found a <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/75155697/4222206\">simiar post</a> that explains why StartMain works plus at the same time state it is no good design. Remains for my question: What would be a better design or practise?</p>\n"
