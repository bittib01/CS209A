    "title": "Bluetooth connection with Android (versions: 12,13,14)using Java android",
    "body": "<p>Hello Stack Overflow Community,</p>\n<p>I have encountered compatibility issues with my Android app in JAVA that uses the HC-05 Bluetooth module. We developed an android application to interact with the hardware machine. The app works properly on Android versions 11 and lower, establishing Bluetooth connections as intended. However, when used on Android versions higher than 11, it can be ono versions: 12/13/14, the app crashes and fails to establish Bluetooth connections; App stops working.</p>\n<p>I have researched potential solutions and would like to seek your advice on addressing this issue. Here are the solutions I've considered so far:</p>\n<p>Updating runtime permissions\nManaging location services for Bluetooth\nAdapting to API changes and new permissions\nBluetooth legacy mode compatibility\nManifest and Gradle configuration verification\nLogs and debugging implementation\nTesting across different devices and versions\nHardware and firmware assessment and updates</p>\n<p>If anyone has proper solution on this...then please let us know.!</p>\n<p>we tried all the possible things that will help to resolve this problem from changing the gradle version to SDK versions as well. but it's now working. Tried all the Github repos but it did not solved. Tried various AI models as well!</p>\n"
