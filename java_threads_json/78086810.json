    "title": "Using local libraries in a maven project with Open Liberty Dev mode",
    "body": "<p>I have a maven project that builds a war that is deployed to Open Liberty. I am using the Liberty maven plugin:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-xml prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;plugin&gt;\n    &lt;groupId&gt;io.openliberty.tools&lt;/groupId&gt;\n    &lt;artifactId&gt;liberty-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n    &lt;version&gt;3.9&lt;/version&gt;\n    &lt;!-- Specify configuration, executions for liberty-maven-plugin --&gt;\n&lt;/plugin&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>I am leveraging Dev mode and its working nicely. However, I want to use local jar file libraries with Dev mode.</p>\n<p>I was expecting that I might be able to place the jars files in a particular location in the project, and they would be automatically be picked up by Liberty dev mode - in a similar way to how the <code>server.xml</code> is automatically picked up from <code>src/main/liberty/config</code>. My <code>server.xml</code> is set up to look for the libraries here: <code>${shared.config.dir}/lib/global</code>, so I tried putting the jars in <code>src/main/liberty/shared/config/lib/global</code> but that doesn't work.</p>\n<p>One alternative I can see is to use the <code>copyDependencies</code> configuration for the liberty plugin.</p>\n<p>Is there some recommended way to achieve what I want to do? Ideally I want the simplest solution that will work for liberty dev mode, and also for a vanilla maven build (<code>mvn package</code>).</p>\n<p>Similar question here leverages the <code>copyDependencies</code> configuration, but specifically I am looking for the best solution for local jars (yes, I could use system scoped maven coordinates or install the jar locally)\n<a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58051063/how-to-copy-external-dependency-to-open-liberty-during-maven-build\">How to copy external dependency to Open Liberty during maven build</a></p>\n<p>Thanks</p>\n"
