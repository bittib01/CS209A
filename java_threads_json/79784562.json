    "title": "JAX-RS REST API returns 200 OK immediately, but JSON body arrives delayed only on my computer",
    "body": "<p>I have a JAX-RS REST API that gets live images from a camera.\nThe camera returns a multipart response (XML + JPEG), which I parse in the service and then return as JSON in the response.</p>\n<p>Problem:</p>\n<p>When I send a request from my local computer using Postman, I immediately get 200 OK with minimal content (for example, 1), but after a short delay the full JSON data appears.</p>\n<p>When I send the same request from other computers, the response arrives all at once, without delay.</p>\n<p>The controller looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code>@Path(&quot;/real-time-image&quot;)\n@GET\npublic Response getLiveImage() {\n    return liveImageService.getImage();\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Question:</p>\n<p>Why does the JSON appear delayed only on my computer, while I tested 3–4 other computers and it works fine there?</p>\n<p>Could this be related to HTTP buffering or network issues?</p>\n<p>How can I ensure that the response is returned only after the full JSON is ready?</p>\n<p>What I tried:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I read the camera's multipart HTTP response fully into a byte array before parsing.</li>\n<li>I parsed the XML and JPEG parts, saved the data to the database, and then built the Response object synchronously.</li>\n<li>I tested the API from multiple computers using Postman:\n<ul>\n<li>On my local machine, I immediately got 200 OK with minimal content (like &quot;1&quot;), then after a short delay the full JSON appeared.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n"
