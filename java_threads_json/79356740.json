    "body": "<p>I have a spring boot application hosted in AWS EKS using the AWS Oracle RDS.\nCurrently the application reads the oracle rds details from the application.yaml file</p>\n<p>The db credentials are hardcoded while we are doing development.</p>\n<p>Prior to going to production i wanted to know what is the best way to read these details with out hardcoding in the yaml file. Happy to have the rds user name and password in the Secrets Manager</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Inject it via the library and use it  - Question : does it update automatically when password is rotated ?</li>\n<li>Use CSI driver and mount the secrets - Question: how do we access this file in the spring boot application ? Is it just a plain file read or is there any preferred way to read the file ?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Any suggestions or the ways you have implemented will be appreciated.</p>\n<p>Any links or industry standards will be appreciated.</p>\n"
