    "title": "Spring Security 6.5.0: Deprecation Warning authorizeRequests in XML-based Configuration",
    "body": "<p>I've recently updated Spring Security from version 6.4.4 to the latest version (6.5.0). Since the update, I'm consistently seeing the following warning in my logs:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[DefaultFilterChainValidator.checkAuthorizationFilters:128] Usage of authorizeRequests is deprecated. Please use authorizeHttpRequests in the configuration</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My project exclusively uses XML-based Spring Security configuration, and migrating to Java-based configuration is currently not an option due to project constraints.</p>\n<p>I've reviewed existing answers to similar questions, such as <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74609057/how-to-fix-spring-authorizerequests-is-deprecated\">how-to-fix-spring-authorizerequests-is-deprecated,</a> but they all focus on Java-based configurations and thus do not apply to my situation.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, while the Spring Security documentation still provides examples for XML configuration (e.g., using <code>&lt;intercept-url pattern=&quot;/**&quot; access=&quot;authenticated&quot;/&gt;</code>), my understanding is that even these documented XML constructs are internally translated by Spring Security into the deprecated <code>http.authorizeRequests()...</code> pattern, rather than the recommended <code>http.authorizeHttpRequests((authorize) -&gt; authorize.anyRequest().authenticated())</code> pattern. This seems to be the root cause of the deprecation warning despite using the officially documented XML configuration.</p>\n<p>I've also thoroughly checked the Spring Security 6.5.0 release notes and migration guides but couldn't find any specific information on how to address this warning within an XML-based setup, other than simply suppressing the warning.</p>\n<p>Is there any way to resolve this authorizeRequests deprecation warning in an XML-based Spring Security 6.5.0 configuration without suppressing the warning or migrating to Java-based configuration?</p>\n"
