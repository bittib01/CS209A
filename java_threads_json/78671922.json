    "title": "Why ReentrantLock is better for virtual threads than synchronized?",
    "body": "<p>I've visited some IT conference and on a session about <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/core/virtual-threads.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">virtual threads feature in Java 21+</a> was mentioned that <code>synchronized</code> <em>might(!) be</em> a problem for virtual threads because of pinning virtual thread and if it is a problem - usage of <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/locks/Lock.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Lock</a> could solve the problem.</p>\n<p>I don't understand why Lock could be better than syncronized in context of virtual threads. I suppose that <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/locks/ReentrantLock.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">ReentrantLock</a> could be a cause of the same pinning. isn't it ? If not - why ?</p>\n"
