    "title": "Get program traces with JaCoCo",
    "body": "<p>Looking to retrieve program traces using JaCoCo, on a Maven project in IntelliJ. The overall point is to get as much control flow graph information as possible using JaCoCo, but I understand it might not be fully possible (unless I am incorrect).</p>\n<p>The JaCoCo version is 0.8.11, the test coverage is set up and working fine.</p>\n<p>The only suggested solution I recieved was to add a JaCoCo's Java agent to my JVM options, but IntelliJ official website suggests strongly against that, so I am looking for verification and/or alternative solutions. Any advie will be appreciated.</p>\n"
