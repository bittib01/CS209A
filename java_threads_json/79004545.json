    "body": "<p>I have an application using Tomcat which executes some other java programs. The different java programs are passed to the main application as argument.\nThe main program is using <code>org.apache.commons.exec.DefaultExecutor</code> and <code>org.apache.commons.exec.ExecuteWatchDog</code>.</p>\n<p>When the main application is killed using &quot;kill -9&quot;, the invoked programs are dangling which is a problem. I need to terminate all the invoked programs before the main program is killed.\nI read about shutdown hook but then that is applicable for graceful shutdown. Any suggestion as to what can be a solution?</p>\n"
