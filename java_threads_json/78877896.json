    "body": "<p>Is it possible to somehow customize an <code>ObjectMapper</code> instance so that I can access this customization in a <code>JsonSerializer</code>?</p>\n<p>Let's assume that I can create the <code>ObjectMapper</code> myself but I don't have access over the POJOs that are serialized. Further assume that the <code>JsonSerializer</code> is shared with a lot of projects.</p>\n<p>I'd like to have a feature, just like one of the built-in <code>MapperFeatures</code>, that toggles something. In my <code>JsonSerializer</code> I want to check whether the feature is enabled and serialize one way or the other.</p>\n<p>Here is the signature of <code>serialize</code>:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>public void serialize(ZonedDateTime date, JsonGenerator generator, SerializerProvider provider) throws IOException {\n</code></pre>\n"
