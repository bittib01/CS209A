    "title": "Get classpath without installing maven projects",
    "body": "<p>I have a couple of maven projects with this basic structure:</p>\n<pre><code>root\n  my-group:app\n    my-group:app-core, parent my-group:app\n      class Main\n      dependency foo:foo-lib\n    my-group:app-util, parent my-group:app\n      dependency bar:bar-lib\n  my-group:lib, parent my-group:lib-parent\n    dependency bar:bar-lib\n</code></pre>\n<p>I also have the <code>my-group:lib-parent</code> dependency installed into my .m2</p>\n<pre><code>.m2\n  my-group:lib-parent\n    dependency qux:qux-lib\n</code></pre>\n<p>I have <code>my-group:app</code> and <code>my-group:lib</code> checked out locally in my IDE. With that, I can update things - both source code and dependencies - and they will be resolved without having to install anything in .m2. For example, if I change something in <code>my-group:lib</code> - e.g. update the version of <code>bar:bar-lib</code> - I don't have to run the whole time-consuming build cycle to install that into .m2.</p>\n<p>The same doesn't seem to work from command line. <code>mvn</code> insists on using what's in .m2 first and I have not found a way to tell it to use the latest from checked out sources.</p>\n<p>My primary motivation is avoiding this cost which is a big hindrance when iterating on the code.</p>\n<p>In this case, all that I need is to run <code>Main</code> that lives in <code>my-group:app-core</code>. If there's a solution similar to <code>mvn dependency:build-classpath</code> that is local-first, .m2-second, that should work.</p>\n<p>I'm not sure if other build systems (e.g. gradle) would allow for this, but even if they did that probably wouldn't work because other people are using maven, so I'd have to maintain two build systems.</p>\n<p>Is there any way to make maven work like this? If not, is there anything else that can work with pom.xml without modifications to <code>my-group:app</code> or <code>my-group:lib</code> projects that would work like this? If not, do I have any options that perhaps modify these projects, but not in a way that makes syncing cumbersome (e.g. adding some unrelated files may be OK, but modifying pom.xml or maintaining an equivalent copy for the other build tool probably not)?</p>\n<p>I tried looking into using <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/maven-resolver\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://github.com/apache/maven-resolver</a>, but what I've tried so far is either very brittle (e.g. doesn't handle versions via properties or dependencyManagement) or requires installing in .m2 anyway, defeating the purpose.</p>\n"
