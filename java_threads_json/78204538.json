    "body": "<p>Under what situation does the Solver will choose to break hard constraint while there is exiting suitable solution with higher soft score.\nwe create this following solution:\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/jcyoW.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">enter image description here</a>\nWe use the FIRST_FIT and Tabu Search algorithm to build this solution, and we run it for some minitues, then we got a reault which breaks many hard constraints, and we find there is existing a solution which not break any hard constraints.</p>\n<p>We let the Solver to explain the solution which we find, the Solver also shows it break 0 hard.</p>\n<p>We wonder what cause this problem. does it cause by the running time? are there any way to let the Solver not try the solution which break the hard contraint?</p>\n"
