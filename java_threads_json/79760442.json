    "title": "I am having issues stating my OSGi application with org.eclipse.equinox.simpleconfigurator",
    "body": "<p>I am trying to start an OSGi app from the Windows command prompt using org.eclipse.equinox.simpleconfigurator and either I am missing something in my config.ini or it doesn't get picked-up for some reason, but I can't tell if it's actually reading my bundles.info. Here is my folder structure:</p>\n<pre><code>MyApp\n  plugins\n     (all the eclipse plugins, dependencies and application jar files are under this)\n  configuration\n     config.ini\n     org.eclipse.equinox.simpleconfigurator\n         bundles.info\n</code></pre>\n<p>The content of my config.ini is the following:</p>\n<pre><code>    osgi.bundles.defaultStartLevel=4\n    osgi.framework=plugins/org.eclipse.osgi_3.22.0.v20241030-2121.jar\n    osgi.bundles=\\\n    plugins/org.eclipse.osgi_3.22.0.v20241030-2121.jar@1:start,\\\n    plugins/org.eclipse.equinox.simpleconfigurator@1:start,\\\n    plugins/org.eclipse.core.runtime_3.32.0.v20241003-0436.jar@1:start,\\\n    plugins/org.eclipse.equinox.common_3.19.200.v20241004-0654.jar@1:start,\\\n    plugins/org.eclipse.core.jobs_3.15.400.v20240619-0602.jar@2:start,\\\n\n    eclipse.product=MyProduct.product\n    eclipse.buildId=@build@\n    eof=eof\n</code></pre>\n<p>The application is started under the MyApp folder. I do use the -Dorg.eclipse.equinox.simpleconfigurator.configUrl to specify the location of the bundles.info file. I started adding -Dosgi.bundles on the java command line, but I don't think I should be doing that because for every jar file I add, it then complains about missing dependencies and in the end I'll have to add every single jar files from the plugins folder which defeats the purpose of having them defined in bundles.info.</p>\n<p>Here is an example of an entry in my bundles.info:</p>\n<pre><code>org.eclipse.core.commands,3.12.200.v20240627-1019,plugins/org.eclipse.core.commands_3.12.200.v20240627-1019.jar,4,false\n</code></pre>\n<p>I assumed the location of the jar files is based on the where the application is started; here since the application is started in the MyApp folder, the proper location is plugins/myjar.jar</p>\n<p>Any pointer about how to solve this is appreciated.</p>\n<p>Thanks</p>\n"
