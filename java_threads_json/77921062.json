    "title": "Is cvc5 able to minimize or maximize an expression, given a set of constraints?",
    "body": "<p>Other mathematical solvers, such as z3 or cplex, are able to solve mathematical models with multiple constraints with the purpose to minimize/maximize an expression, such as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>a+b=10; 2&lt;=b&lt;=6 <br> objective: minimize(a)=&gt; a:=4</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, I can't seem to find any such options in the cvc5 specification. Am I missing something, or does this feature simply not exist?</p>\n<p><em>Currently we're using cplex for such an application, but we're trying to find a solver which isn't as expensive and is deterministic (unlike z3)</em></p>\n"
