    "title": "Removing a dependency after compilation in Android?",
    "body": "<p>In Java, a class dependency is required to perform a compilation of a source code file. However, running a compiled file without the reference will give is a <code>ClassNotFoundException</code>. Consider the following:</p>\n<pre><code>import de.robv.android.xposed.XposedBridge;\n................\n................\nprivate boolean testUseClassDirectly() {\n        try {\n            XposedBridge.log(&quot;blah&quot;);\n            return true;\n        }\n        catch(Throwable unused_ex) {\n            return false;\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this case it would compile only if the <code>de.robv.android.xposed.XposedBridge</code> reference is found. I'm able to provide the reference in a java, class or jarfile for compilation purposes. However, generating the exception and handling it is a normal flow of the design of the app that performs certain checks and used the class directly or proceed in a certain way if it doesn't based on those checks.</p>\n<p>How to I build the app in an Android environment (ideally Android studio) without including the class dependency in the APK file?</p>\n"
