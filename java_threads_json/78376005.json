    "title": "GSI parallel query for vertical scaling of ECS",
    "body": "<p>I have an Application deployed in ECS, which query Dynamodb on the <code>status</code> column using GSI and perform some computations and update the <code>status</code>.</p>\n<p>My problem is querying the GSI in pagination takes a long time, I want to scale application horizontally i.e increase the desired count from 1 to 5. Which will launch 5 ecs task of the same application. Doing this makes it difficult to query.</p>\n<p>One approach I can think about is adding a sort key to gsi and adding values like 1,2,3,4,5 and then the task definition 1 will query on records with sort key 1 and so on. But the problem here is I cannot think of a query that will achieve the same.</p>\n<p>Need help to get thing working. I am doing this in java</p>\n"
