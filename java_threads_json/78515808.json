    "title": "Setting JAVA_HOME in Mac (not personal)",
    "body": "<p>I got a Mac (M3 pro) for work. I have installed Java 17 (Temurin) and Java 8 (Amazon) for a project specific requirement. Now when I tried to set the JAVA_HOME (<code>export JAVA_HOME=&quot;/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/temurin-17.0.10/Contents/Home&quot;</code>), I get the following message when I try to <code>echo $JAVA_HOME</code>: <em>&quot;Using system JDK, no JAVA_HOME set!&quot;</em>.</p>\n<p>I am facing this problem for past 3 days. Please help me in this regard.</p>\n<p>I was trying to set the JAVA_HOME and using the <code>export JAVA_HOME=&quot;/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/temurin-17.0.10/Contents/Home&quot;</code> in .zshrc file. When running the direct export cmd in terminal as well as iTerm2 also, JAVA_HOME is not set. When I try to <code>echo $JAVA_HOME</code> I get the following message:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Using system JDK, no JAVA_HOME set!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I am not sure is it permissions issue on my Mac or a Java installation issue.</p>\n"
