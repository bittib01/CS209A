    "title": "RestClient returns 403 after apache.httpclient5 upgrade from 5.3.1 to 5.4",
    "body": "<p>I use <code>RestClient.Builder</code> to build a <em>RestClient</em> instance with a custom request factory backed by <em>apache.httpclient5</em> in an application written with <em>SpringBoot 3.3.6</em>. Initially, <em>apache.httpclient 5.3.1</em> was used and everything was working just fine. After upgrading the dependency to <em>apache.httpclient 5.4</em> all initiated requests started to fail with <code>403 [No body]</code> response. Downgrading back to 5.3.1 solved the issue. Does anyone know what could be causing the issue and how to fix it?</p>\n<p>Here's how the <em>RestClient</em> is constructed:</p>\n<pre><code>ClientHttpRequestFactorySettings settings = \n    ClientHttpRequestFactorySettings.DEFAULTS\n        .withConnectTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(120))\n        .withReadTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(120));\nvar requestFactory = ClientHttpRequestFactories.get(settings);\n\n// RestClient.Builder restClientBuilder\n\nvar restClient = restClientBuilder\n    .requestFactory(requestFactory)\n    .baseUrl(url)\n    .build();\n</code></pre>\n<p>Thank you</p>\n"
