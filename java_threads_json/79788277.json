    "body": "<p>I'm working on my first personal project - <a href=\"https://github.com/Arggonaut/java-blackjack\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">making a simple game of blackjack</a> with Java and Java Swing (just what my class is going over) and I want to make it so that when a card is drawn in succession by the program (as compared to when the player presses the hit button), there is a slight pause in between each card being drawn.</p>\n<p>Here is my method that uses <code>Thread.sleep()</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>public static void pause(int time) {\n    //makes java pause for a certain amount of time in ms\n    try {\n        Thread.sleep(time);\n    }\n    catch (InterruptedException e) {\n        \n    }\n\n}   \n</code></pre>\n<p>I'm not sure if I'm just using it wrong, but whenever I have it like this:</p>\n<pre><code>public void drawFirstCards(){\n    //draw the initial two cards for the player and the dealer\n    hit(dealer);\n    pause(DRAW_DELAY);\n    hit(dealer);\n    pause(DRAW_DELAY);\n    hit(user);\n    pause(DRAW_DELAY);\n    hit(user);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>It works how I want it. I wanted to make it less 'copy and pasty' so I tried putting it in the hit method like this:</p>\n<pre><code>public void hit(Player player){\n    //draw a card and add its value to the score. If the score is over 21, the player state is bust. If the score is 21, the player state is blackjack.\n    Card drawnCard = deck.drawCard();\n    player.addCard(drawnCard);\n    player.addScore(drawnCard.getValue());\n    user.revalidate();\n    user.repaint();\n    pause(DRAW_DELAY);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>But now, the program but now, whenever I use the hit button, the icon of the card comes out after the pause rather than before which I don't like since it makes it feel laggy.</p>\n<p>Also, theres a bit of code later where I have a while loop that also uses my pause method:</p>\n<pre><code>public void dealersTurn() { //After the user stands or gets a blackjack, the dealer starts drawing cards\n   //draw cards until either the dealer busts or the dealer gets a score that is greater than or equal to the user\n   while (dealer.getScore() &lt; BLACKJACK &amp;&amp; dealer.getScore() &lt; user.getScore()) {\n       hit(dealer);\n       pause(DRAW_DELAY);\n   }\n</code></pre>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>I thought that the program would draw a card, wait, and then draw another card but instead it does all of the card draws and you have to wait the combined wait time before the icons come up in the gui.</p>\n<p>Can someone help me understand Threads.sleep() better so that I can get it to work how I want? Or, is there a better way to get the little pauses?</p>\n"
