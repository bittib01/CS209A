    "title": "Efficiency difference between different ways of finding min &amp; max in a Java list",
    "body": "<p>I've found questions similar to this one, such as <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2103606/is-math-maxa-b-or-abab-faster-in-java\">this</a> but I haven't found one answering this exact question.  I have a list of numbers and I want to iterate through them to find the minimum and maximum values.  I am wondering if there would be any performance difference between using <code>if</code>/<code>else</code> statements and <code>Math.min</code>/<code>Math.max</code>.</p>\n<p>So if I start with the following:</p>\n<pre><code>List&lt;Integer&gt; list = null;\nint min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;\nint max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;\n</code></pre>\n<p>I could then use <code>if</code>/<code>else</code> like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-kotlin prettyprint-override\"><code>for (int currentNum : list) {\n    if (currentNum &lt; min) {\n        min = currentNum;\n    }\n    if (currentNum &gt; max) {\n        max = currentNum;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>or <code>Math.max</code> &amp; <code>Math.min</code> like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-kotlin prettyprint-override\"><code>for (int currentNum : list) {\n    min = Math.min(min, currentNum);\n    max = Math.max(max, currentNum);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I like the second one because it feels more expressive (and it's shorter).  But one might think it could be slower because it's doing variable assignment every time, even if it's being set to the same value.  Then again, I've been told the JVM's JIT compiler is very smart and perhaps can optimize this.</p>\n<p>So could there a performance difference?</p>\n"
