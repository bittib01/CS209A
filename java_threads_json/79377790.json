    "body": "<p>I have a List that is given as a parameter to a query method like so:</p>\n<pre><code>@Query(value = &quot;SELECT n FROM Names n WHERE n.name IN (:names)&quot;\npublic List&lt;NameDTO&gt; getNames(@Param(&quot;names&quot;) List&lt;String&gt; names);\n</code></pre>\n<p>The problem is that because the names list can be empty or null, this query will not execute. You can add a guard that checks if names is null before executing the IN clause but hibernate will not be tricked this way. I have tried a lot of alternatives, but nothing seems to work.\nDoes someone recognizes this problem and what can be done about it?</p>\n"
