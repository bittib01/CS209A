    "title": "How can I make Java request focus when a window is closed from the taskbar?",
    "body": "<p>I detect when a window is closed by the user so I can prompt to save, by adding a window listener and <code>windowClosing()</code>. If there is unsaved work I request focus for that window, then use <code>JOptionPane</code>.</p>\n<p>This works if that window is focused. But if the user closes the window by hovering over the taskbar and clicking the close button there, then <em>sometimes</em> the window gains focus but sometimes just flashes on the task bar (and does not get focused). I need this to behave consistently. If this is platform-specific there might not be a solution (I am using Windows 11).</p>\n<pre><code>window.setDefaultCloseOperation(WindowConstants.DO_NOTHING_ON_CLOSE);\nwindow.addWindowListener(new WindowAdapter() {\n    public void windowClosing(final WindowEvent e) {\n        window.requestFocus();\n        window.toFront();\n        JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(window, &quot;Not saved&quot;, &quot;Not saved&quot;, JOptionPane.ERROR_MESSAGE);\n    }\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>Using <code>SwingUtilities.invokeLater</code> separately on the focus request and the <code>JOptionPane</code> makes no difference.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/A2sGVmM8.gif\" alt=\"An example of what is currently happening if the window is not already focused when it is closed by the user\" /></p>\n"
