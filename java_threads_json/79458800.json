    "title": "Why can I query for a column of type CHAR by an integer?",
    "body": "<p>I have a table with a column of type CHAR, let's call it <code>CHAR_COL</code>.</p>\n<p>The value of <code>CHAR_COL</code> is something like <code>00123456</code>.</p>\n<p>I run a query such as: <code>SELECT * FROM table where CHAR_COL = 123456</code></p>\n<p>Results are returned for the row where <code>CHAR_COL</code> is <code>00123456</code></p>\n<p>I am wondering why this is possible. Why doesn't it take the leading 00's into account?</p>\n<p>In our Java application I have created a JPA Query with the input number I am looking for, but it must be converted to a String and contain the leading 00's, otherwise it does not find the record. I am trying to figure out a way to make this work similarly to how I am calling it without leading 00's.</p>\n"
