    "title": "Why is my program to find prime numbers within a range not working the way it&#39;s supposed to",
    "body": "<p>I tried creating a program to find prime numbers within a range. The user is asked to input two numbers then the goal of the program will be to print out the prime numbers between the first number and the last number.</p>\n<p>Here's my code below:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>import java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // program to check prime numbers b/w two numbers\n        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);\n        byte factorsCount = 0;\n\n        System.out.println(&quot;Enter first number: &quot;);\n        int numOne = sc.nextInt();\n        System.out.println(&quot;Enter second number: &quot;);\n        int numTwo = sc.nextInt();\n\n        System.out.println(&quot;The prime numbers are: &quot;);\n\n        for (int i = numOne+1; i &lt; numTwo; i++) {\n            for (int j = 1; j &lt;= i; j++) {\n                if (i%j == 0) {\n                    factorsCount++;\n                }\n            }\n            if (factorsCount == 2) {\n                System.out.println(i);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The problem is that the program is not working as intended. For some numOne and numTwo it prints some prime numbers whilst for others it prints nothing</p>\n<p>The way I intended for it to work is as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It asks the user for the first number and the second number. It then creates a variable to store the no. of factors a specific number has</li>\n<li>The outer for loop iterates through the numbers between the first and second number</li>\n<li>The inner for loop counts the number of factors a number has</li>\n<li>After the inner loop is done, it breaks out of the inner loop then checks if the factorsCount is equal to 2. if yes, then it is a prime number hence it prints it out and if no it just goes to the next number within the range</li>\n<li>It repeats steps one through four until it has exhausted the numbers within the Range after which it must have printed all the prime numbers</li>\n</ol>\n"
