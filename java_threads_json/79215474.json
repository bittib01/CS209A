    "title": "How do I use a client certificate with Apache CXF?",
    "body": "<p>I am trying to use my SOAP API with Apache CXF, but the API requires SSL client certificates. I saw that there is some XML-Config you can use, but I would like to do this programmatically. Setting the <code>sslContext</code> within the <code>tlsClientParameters</code> doesn't seem to work either. This is my code:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-kotlin prettyprint-override\"><code>val service = SoapyService()\nval port = service.soapyPort\n\nval cond = ClientProxy.getClient(port).conduit\n(cond as HTTPConduit).apply {\n    tlsClientParameters =\n        TLSClientParameters().apply {\n            sslContext = sslContextWithCert\n        }\n}\nval result = port.login(username, password)\n</code></pre>\n<p>But the server terminates the connection during SSL handshake due to missing certificate.</p>\n"
