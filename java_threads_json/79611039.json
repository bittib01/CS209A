    "title": "Is it safe to catch stack overflows? Can it leave objects in messy/intermediate states?",
    "body": "<p>I've been reviewing ways to kill threads in Java, and the overwhelming conclusion is that it is never safe to stop code at arbitrary points - doing so may leave resources in messy intermediate states. This is why <code>Thread.stop()</code> was deprecated forever and eventually removed in favor of cooperative thread management.</p>\n<p>However, it occurs to me that this is exactly what a stack overflow does - it may be thrown from (as I understand it) any line of java code that tries to reach for more stack space than is available. If you catch a stack overflow exception from an arbitrary thread (in my use case, semi-trusted user code), can that mean runtime objects are left in illegal states? (Un-released locks, open connections, &quot;atomic&quot; operations stopped halfway thru?)</p>\n"
