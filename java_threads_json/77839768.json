    "title": "Proguard version error: Unsupported version number [61.0] maximum 57.0, Java 13",
    "body": "<p>I have a maven project which was recently bumped up to Java 17. Along with that the Proguard version was also bumped to 7.2.2 from 6.2.2. I tried building it on my system but faced the error mentioned. I also noticed that in the trace logs the proguard versions did not match. I tried to copy the plugins from someone, on whose machine the project built successfully. My JAVA_HOME is also pointing to where jdk 17 is. Please share your insights if you have faced similar issue in the past or knows the solution to it.</p>\n<p>The version updated pom.xml:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;configuration&gt;\n    &lt;proguardVersion&gt;7.2.2&lt;/proguardVersion&gt;\n    &lt;libs&gt;\n        &lt;lib&gt;${java.home}/jmods&lt;/lib&gt;\n    &lt;/libs&gt;\n&lt;/configuration&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>The error I'm getting:</p>\n<pre><code>[proguard] Reading library directory [C:\\dev\\jdk17.0.8_8\\jmods] (filtered)\n[proguard] Error: Can't read [C:\\dev\\jdk17.0.8_8\\jmods] (Can't read [java.base.jmod] (Can't process class [module-info.class] (Unsupported version number [61.0] (maximum 57.0, Java 13))))\n\n[ERROR] Failed to execute goal com.github.wvengen:proguard-maven-plugin:2.6.0:proguard (default) on project project.api: Obfuscation failed (result=1) -&gt; [Help 1]\n[ERROR]\n[ERROR] To see the full stack trace of the errors, re-run Maven with the -e switch.\n[ERROR] Re-run Maven using the -X switch to enable full debug logging.\n[ERROR]\n[ERROR] For more information about the errors and possible solutions, please read the following articles:\n[ERROR] [Help 1] http://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MAVEN/MojoExecutionException\n</code></pre>\n<p>The weird thing I noticed in the build traces:</p>\n<pre><code>[INFO] proguard jar: [C:\\Users\\rohan.dahiya\\.m2\\repository\\com\\guardsquare\\proguard-base\\7.2.2\\proguard-base-7.2.2.jar]\n [proguard] ProGuard, version 6.2.2\n [proguard] Reading program directory [D:\\project\\api\\target\\classes_proguard_base] (filtered)\n</code></pre>\n<p>The proguard jar has the name appended with 7.2.2 version but in the very next line it says: <code>[proguard] ProGuard, version 6.2.2</code></p>\n"
