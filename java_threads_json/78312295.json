    "title": "Is there a way to extend an interface with Jakarta endpoints as a Quarkus Rest Client without adding any additional endpoints?",
    "body": "<p>I'm trying to create and Inject a RestClient interface into my Quarkus application. This rest client interface extends another interface from an external library where all my endpoints are configured. I am on Quarkus 3 and am using the quarkus-rest-client-reactive-jackson library.</p>\n<p>This is the rest client</p>\n<pre><code>@Path(&quot;path/path&quot;)\n@RegisterRestClient(configKey = &quot;my-service&quot;)\npublic interface IMyRestService extends IServiceEndpoints {\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is the external interface</p>\n<pre><code>@Path(&quot;path/path&quot;)\npublic interface IServiceEndpoints{\n    \n    @POST\n    @Path(&quot;&quot;)\n    @Consumes({&quot;text/plain&quot;})\n    @Produces({&quot;text/plain&quot;})\n    String doAction(String description);\n\n    &lt;more endpoints&gt;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>When I try to run this, I get a unsatisfied dependency build error. I can solve this error by implementing an endpoint in my rest client layer. I was wondering if there's a way to fix this error without having to add an (in my case nonsensical) endpoint to my rest client. I know ideally that I would just put endpoints into the rest client without the library layer, but that's not how this project is structured unfortunately.</p>\n"
