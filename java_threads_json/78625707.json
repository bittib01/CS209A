    "title": "How to measure benefit of virtual thread?",
    "body": "<p>I migrated a Java 17 application to Java 21 and enabled virtual thread for the application.</p>\n<p>Microservice Detail:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>20 requests per second on a container.</li>\n<li>Scaling in switched on for this service. Whenever average CPU hits 30% new container is launched.</li>\n<li>Usually 50 containers are running for this service.</li>\n<li>Without virtual thread, one container used to have an average of 2.5k platform threads running every minute.</li>\n<li>We are using GRPC server on this service.</li>\n<li>Request Detail:\n<ul>\n<li>One requests which is on platform thread, generally uses 6-7 parallel platform thread to fetch data from different data source(I/O).</li>\n<li>We have converted the later 6-7 platform threads to virtual thread using ExecutorService.</li>\n<li>We are not able to move the user request to virtual thread as grcp server does not support it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When we go live, I can see earlier system used to have 2.5k active platform thread on an avergage. Now it has reduced to 200. But apart from this I am not observing any other benefit.</p>\n<p>What I thought, I will observe</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Increase in throughput per container.</li>\n<li>Number of containers used should have reduced as now less context switching because of less active platform threads.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I am seeing no benefit apart from reducing number of platform threads.</p>\n<p>What I am missing?\nWhat other parameters I should check which will show improvements?</p>\n"
