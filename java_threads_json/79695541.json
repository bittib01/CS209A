    "body": "<p>With Jetty 9.x I was able to have separated logging config for my webapp and Jetty.</p>\n<p>I've migrated to Jetty 12.0.22, and now Jetty uses <a href=\"https://www.slf4j.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">slf4j</a>.</p>\n<p>My app used to use <code>logback-classic</code> through <code>slf4j</code>, but it is now forced to use the same slf4j implementation that Jetty uses.</p>\n<p>How to make logging config in both environments independent from the other one?</p>\n<p>Previously, I didn't have any issue, because Jetty didn't use slf4j, and did not interfere with my use of logback.</p>\n<p>I've tried to use logback-classic for both jetty and my webapp, but I have some custom appenders and formatters that lie in my webapp code.</p>\n<p>Related doc:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://jetty.org/docs/jetty/12/programming-guide/troubleshooting/logging.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Official Jetty doc</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jetty/jetty.project/issues/13327\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Issue</a> opened to the Jetty team.</li>\n</ul>\n"
