    "body": "<p>I am trying to pass some initialization values from jni to java.</p>\n<p>I have been able locate and correctly call the java method from my JNILib Init function but when I try to call it from a different function, the app crashes because it seems that I do not have the current class, method and env pointers.\nI have tried to store these pointers from my init function to some global variables but this didn't work.</p>\n<p>I am trying to call</p>\n<pre><code>env-&gt;CallStaticVoidMethod (class, method, jstr);\n</code></pre>\n<p>from a void function different than the jnilibInit function and I am not sure how to retain the pointers.</p>\n<p>I haven't been able to find the class or the method from this function.</p>\n"
