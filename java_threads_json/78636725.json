    "body": "<p>I'm using the JSch library to download a file from an SFTP server using <code>ChannelSftp</code>. The basic download works as expected with the following code:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>channelSftp.get(String source, String destination);\n</code></pre>\n<p>If the connection is interrupted during transfer, how can I resume the download from where it left off instead of restarting from the beginning?</p>\n<p>Is there a way to achieve this with ChannelSftp, or do I need to implement a workaround?</p>\n"
