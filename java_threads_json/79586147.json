    "title": "Change line separator by programming",
    "body": "<p>In Java, we use a BuffedWriter and the newline() method. Previously, you could change the character of the new line by changing the system property &quot;Line.separator&quot;. Unfortunately, the Newline method seems to use System.LineSeparator() which is initialized at the very beginning from the &quot;Line.separator&quot; property. How can we change the character to use by the Newline() method, without changing newline() by the call of write()? We need to change it by programming. We cannot change the JVM argument, as the research program the line separator it must use.</p>\n<p>It works in Java 1.8 and not in 11. We see nothing in Java's documentation that could prevent us from doing this.</p>\n"
