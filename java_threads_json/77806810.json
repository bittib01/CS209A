    "title": "Does Manifold preprocessor support splitting the code base",
    "body": "<p>Given that I use Manifold, a Java compiler plugin, and more specificaly the preprocessor, which acts very much like C/C++ directives, is it possible to split the code base based on these directives.</p>\n<p>For example</p>\n<pre><code>#if VERSION_1\n old java code\n#elif VERSION_2\n new java code\n#else\n  #error &quot;Unsupported version&quot;\n#end if\n</code></pre>\n<p>I would like to generate the source code without the directives based on the version defined.\nIt is not clear to me if this is possible.</p>\n"
