    "title": "Is there a reason to use HashSet + List over LinkedHashSet for unique and ordered collection of objects?",
    "body": "<p>I need to maintain an ordered collection of inputs that disallows duplicates.</p>\n<p>The obvious option is <code>LinkedHashSet</code>, but a less obvious option might be a combination of <code>HashSet</code> and <code>List</code>. Here's an example showing both implementations:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>class TestClass{\n    private final Set&lt;ThingIds&gt; setOfThingIds;\n    private final List&lt;Thing&gt; listOfThings;\n    private final Set&lt;Thing&gt; linkedHashSetOfThings;\n\n    // ... constructor instantiates empty objects\n\n    void addThingsViaList(List&lt;Thing&gt; things){\n        for(var thing: things){\n            var id = getThingId(thing);\n            if(setOfThingIds.contains(id)) continue;\n            setOfThingIds.add(id);\n            listOfThings.add(thing);\n        }\n    }\n\n    void addThingsViaSet(List&lt;Thing&gt; things){\n        for(var thing: things){\n            linkedHashSetOfThings.add(thing); // thingId calc added to Thing's equals method\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>When would the first method be useful/required over the second?</p>\n<p>One reason I could think of is if there were some bespoke expensive logic to be used for ids so adding it here would localise it and reduce the performance impact (as opposed to adding it on the <code>equals()</code> method where it would be used everywhere...though this is a weak argument since it could be stored on <code>Thing</code> as a field and invoked lazily from <code>equals()</code>)...are there any other? Especially ones that aren't micro-optimisations?</p>\n"
