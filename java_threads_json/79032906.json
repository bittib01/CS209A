    "body": "<p>I'm building a project in Java and using Maven for project management. I'm trying to connect to the CoinDCX WebSocket API to fetch real-time cryptocurrency data, but I'm encountering issues.</p>\n<p>Specifically, I'm receiving error codes <code>504</code> and <code>1002</code>. The application accepts the input but fails to connect to the WebSocket. All my dependencies are correctly set up, and the JDK version is correct, but it still isn't fetching the data.</p>\n<p>I've double-checked the WebSocket endpoint, network connectivity, and firewall settings, but the problem persists. Has anyone faced a similar issue or can provide guidance on how to resolve this connection error?</p>\n"
