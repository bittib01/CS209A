    "body": "<p>This is my first time making a minecraft mod for fabric 1.21.3. I used a fabric mod template from the\nofficial fabric website, and put it into Intellij IDEA and I waited for gradle to build at the start, but then it came out with:</p>\n<pre><code> Build file 'C:\\Users\\...\\unrelated-1.21.3\\build.gradle' line: 2\n\nPlugin [id: 'fabric-loom', version: '1.8-SNAPSHOT'] was not found in any of the following sources:\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note: unrelated is the name of my mod</p>\n<p>What I hoped would happen is my project would build and I could begin programming. Here is the part of my build.gradle file:</p>\n<pre><code>plugins {\n    id &quot;fabric-loom&quot; version &quot;1.8-SNAPSHOT&quot;\n    id &quot;maven-publish&quot;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>In my settings.gradle, I have:</p>\n<pre><code>pluginManagement {\n    repositories {\n        maven {\n            name = &quot;Fabric&quot;\n            url = &quot;https://maven.fabricmc.net/&quot;\n        }\n        mavenCentral()\n        gradlePluginPortal()\n    }\n}`\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>When I ran the issue with stacktrace, it came out with:</p>\n<pre><code>* Exception is:\norg.gradle.api.plugins.UnknownPluginException: Plugin [id: 'fabric-loom', version: '1.8-SNAPSHOT'] was not found in any of the following sources:\n\n- Gradle Core Plugins (not a core plugin. For more available plugins, please refer to https://docs.gradle.org/8.10.2/userguide/plugin_reference.html in the Gradle documentation.)\n- Included Builds (No included builds contain this plugin)\n- Plugin Repositories (could not resolve plugin artifact 'fabric-loom:fabric-loom.gradle.plugin:1.8-SNAPSHOT')\n  Searched in the following repositories:\n    Fabric(https://maven.fabricmc.net/)\n    MavenRepo\n    Gradle Central Plugin Repository\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can see that it searched in the mave.fabricmc.net, which I then accessed on my browser and confirmed the version of fabric-loom was correct. I have tried using a different software (visual studio code) and also have tried using a different version of fabric loom, I have watched other videos in which they were able to build immediately without error. I also tried the template on github rather than the generator, all to no avail. Please help me.</p>\n"
