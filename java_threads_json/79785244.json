    "body": "<p>I've got two lists in my Java app: The first contains commands, the second the according valid replies, which I compare to the actual replies:</p>\n<pre><code>private final String[] commands = {&quot;Do something&quot;,&quot;Do something else&quot;,&quot;Do a third thing&quot;};\nprivate final String[] replies = {&quot;Step is done: 123,345&quot;,&quot;+OK&quot;,&quot;Process X finished&quot;};\n\nfor(int i=0;i&lt;commands.length;i++) {\n    sendCommand(commands[i]);\n    String reply = receiveReply();\n\n    if(reply.equals(replies[i])) {\n        System.out.println(&quot;Success!&quot;);\n    } else {\n        System.err.println(&quot;Error: &quot;+reply);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The &quot;X&quot; in the last reply can be any number. Probably &lt;100 but I don't know it in advance (it's sent by an external program that I don't control). I currently also don't care what number it is.</p>\n<p>What I want to do: Check the validity of the last reply but ignore the number.</p>\n<p>I'm aware that I can just do something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>if(i==commands.length-1) {\n    if(reply.startsWith(&quot;Process&quot;) &amp;&amp; reply.endsWith(&quot;finished&quot;) {\n        System.out.println(&quot;Success!&quot;);\n    }\n} else {\n    //Regular checks ^\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This however requires the extra &quot;ugly&quot; check of <code>i</code>.</p>\n<p>Is there any kind of placeholder (e.g.&quot;{{X}}&quot;) that I can use to ignore that part? I know of regex of course but I've got pretty much no experience with it. I found <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/37963932/2016165\">this answer</a> that uses <code>(.*)</code> to search for two placeholder texts in a String and I know that <code>^[0-9]*$</code> matches any number, so I could combine these to match the last reply but that would still require the extra <code>if</code>. This becomes more complicated because almost every reply contains at least one special character, like a comma, colon, plus sign or quotation mark (I know that regex uses at least <code>+</code>).</p>\n<p>How do I use the same &quot;clean&quot; check for every reply, including the last one? Is this even possible with just basic Java 8?</p>\n"
