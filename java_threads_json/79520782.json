    "title": "How can maintain two maven projects individually in two separate folder with same dependency library?",
    "body": "<p>I would like to have two independent maven projects in two different folder like <code>c:\\test\\ProjectOne</code> and <code>c:\\test\\ProjectTwo</code>. In both maven project i would like to have a dependency library, for eg; selenium, with two different versions. In <code>ProjectOne, would want to have selenium with version 3.141.0</code> and in <code>ProjectTwo, would want to have selenium with version 4.26.0</code>. As even though both are two different maven projects,</p>\n<ol>\n<li>will it be a problem to have this kind of setup?</li>\n<li>As our maven dependencies will be in our <code>c:\\user\\&lt;user&gt;\\.m2</code> folder, how does both the projects selenium version will be present. Will it override one over other? or does it harm in any of the projects?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>please help me understand the logic here.</p>\n"
