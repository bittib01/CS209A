    "title": "Grid rendering problems",
    "body": "<p>I am trying to simply render a grid with some test colors to a 1920x1080 screen to see if it works. However, it's looking terrible and it's laden with graphical errors. The grid should just look sort of like a gradient from black to blue from the left side to the right side. However, this is how it's looking right now. Though it's pretty, cool, it's not intended. <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/19Yfa8o3.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/19Yfa8o3.png\" alt=\"current grid test\" /></a></p>\n<p>I don't know how to fix it, so I have been messing with the numbers in my code for forever, but it still doesn't work. I don't know if it's the code I have most recently made or the method for making the rectangle. My basic thought process was: set the starting index, draw a row, go to new line, repeat steps 2-3. So, can anyone help fix my terrible code?</p>\n<p>Here's some code, but if there's not enough context, the files are <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xFyKiWhg06-XxgtOqsR3LLJAOBeDD4kb?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here.</a> There's so much code for this that I don't know if this is enough to figure out the problem. The points of interest are in the CustomPanel file.</p>\n<pre><code> private void showPlayArea()\n    {\n        playAreaW = width - (width % 30);\n        playAreaH = height - (height % 20);\n        int startX = (int)(0.5 * (width - playAreaW));\n        int startY = (int)(0.5 * (height - playAreaH));\n        gridSizeX = playAreaW / 30;//make a 30x20 grid\n        gridSizeY = playAreaH / 20;\n        int currentAddress = 0;\n        currentAddress += (startY - 1) * width;//set starting address to top left corner of first grid box\n        currentAddress += (startX - 1) + gridSizeX;\n        \n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 19; i++)//can't do the full 20 rows or it will fire index out of bounds for the array of pixels on screen\n        {\n            for (int ii = 0; ii &lt; 30 ; ii++)//can't do full 30 rows or it will fire index out of bounds for the array of pixels on screen\n            {\n                System.out.println(i + &quot; &quot; + ii + &quot; &quot; + currentAddress); // prints row and column of grid box being rendered\n                setPixelRect(currentAddress, gridSizeX, gridSizeY, ii * 50);\n                //setPixelRect takes an address, width and height of the rect, then a color to set it and ii*50 is just to make each cell a different color\n                currentAddress += gridSizeX;\n            }\n            currentAddress += (width * (gridSizeY - 1)) - gridSizeX;\n            System.out.println(&quot;-----&quot;); //shows when a new line is made\n        }\n        \n    }\n</code></pre>\n"
