    "title": "Spring boot Framework LDAPTemplate PoolingContextSource not working during ldle scenario",
    "body": "<p><strong>Problem Description:</strong>\nLDAP server suspended new connections due to Spring LDAP Template pool created so many connections in a short period of time. After a while, LDAP server resumed serving requests normally.</p>\n<p><strong>Background of the Problem:</strong></p>\n<p>We have below setting in our app\nminEvictableIdleTimeMillis = 90000\ntimeBetweenEvictionRunsMillis = 15000\nSo, every 15 seconds, the pool scans for idle connections, and evicts those that have been idle for 90+ seconds.</p>\n<p>Under high traffic, application is actively being used and there are no/very less idle connections, pooling settings are working. But during idle scenarios, new connections are keep on getting created even beyond defined total no. of connections.</p>\n<p>But if we keep testWhileIdle=false or timeBetweenEvictionRunsMillis is -1 then pooling works even in low traffic. What we are missing? testOnBorrow is true. What can be a problem here?</p>\n"
