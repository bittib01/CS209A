    "body": "<p>I am a CS student and am starting to work on Leetcode problems. I am trying to use VSCode as my IDE for my solutions but have run into an issue as the IDE is predicting what code I am going to write based on the function names, probably due to the fact that it has seen thousands of similar functions. Does anyone know how to stop this? I have attached a picture below to show what I mean if I explained it poorly.</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/gzWu9.png\" />\n<p>I have looked up solutions to this issue but haven't found anything helpful, it started after I downloaded the Java package for the app and I think it has something to do with IntelliSense or IntelliCode. Thank you for the help.</p>\n"
