The recorded value is stored in RAM.</p>\n<p>I also have a Java program in JavaFX that generates these values for insertion, and its code is open for modification.</p>\n<p>How can I modify a Java program so that the dialog box of the Delphi program is called automatically, and the desired value is also automatically copied there?</p>\n<p>Well, or somehow find out where the necessary values are stored in memory and change them, bypassing the interface?</p>\n"
