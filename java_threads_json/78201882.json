    "title": "How to use GoF design pattern for software robustness?",
    "body": "<p>Robustness is defined by IEEE as &quot;The degree to which a system or component can function correctly in the presence of invalid inputs or stressful environmental conditions&quot;.</p>\n<p>What real-world scenarios can illustrate this problem? And what GoF design patterns are suitable for solving robustness?</p>\n<p>Since the areas of robustness are error handling, fault tolerance, and recoveryability. But I don't have an idea how to use design patterns to solve it.</p>\n<pre><code>class Dao {\n   ... \n   public void timeout() {\n       // some logic here \n       throw new RunTimeException(&quot;This session is timeout&quot;);\n   }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Many exceptions may be defined in the Dao class.</p>\n<p>If I use design patterns to solve this problem, should I create a factory pattern to handle each exception and create a class for each exception?</p>\n"
