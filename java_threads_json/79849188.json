I'm using <code>server.ssl.bundle</code> to setup TLS within Spring Boot.</p>\n<p>The snippet below is from the server hello, captured with Wireshark, looking at PCAP traces of the Java TLS handshake:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-none prettyprint-override\"><code>Certificate types (3 types)\n    Certificate type: ECDSA Sign (64)\n    Certificate type: RSA Sign (1)\n    Certificate type: DSS Sign (2)\n</code></pre>\n<p>I would like to disable DSS Sign.</p>\n<p>I've already disabled some handshake signature algorithms, according to this post: <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79847994/java-tls-how-to-disable-certain-handshake-features\">How to disable certain handshake features</a></p>\n<p>However, I didn't find any related settings in java.security file according to certificate types. How can I disable DSS Sign?</p>\n"
