    "title": "How do I download Hibernate 6.4.4 JARs?",
    "body": "<p>While following Hibernate tutorials on YouTube, they all include a step where they download Hibernate JAR files from the official website, but when I visited the latest version page (Hibernate 6.4.4) there was no download option? So how can I download them please? I am doing a simple JAVA project that have no POM file so I need the JARs to be added to Eclipse in order to be able to integrate it.</p>\n"
