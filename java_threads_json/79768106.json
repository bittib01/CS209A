    "title": "How to set up upgraded JDK/JRE in Eclipse that came as bundle",
    "body": "<p>I have JDK 17 installed on my machine. I imported a Maven project in Eclipse that requires Java 21.</p>\n<p>Eclipse did not have jdk21 compliance in its compiler settings. I installed a new version of Eclipse` that does have a Java 21 compiler. But now project is complaining &quot;Release 21 is not found in the system&quot; in error logs.  Suppose I don't want to install a new JDK in my system. I want to use the one that came up with Eclipse as bundle.</p>\n<p>I checked &quot;Installed JREs&quot;. It is still binds with jdk17.</p>\n<p>Because, new Eclipse came with the bundled java 21, how to set up this bundle with Eclipse?</p>\n<p>In windows, for &quot;Installed JREs&quot; the path is something like <em>C:\\Users...p2\\pool\\plugins\\org.eclipse.justj.openjdk.hotspot.jre.full.win32.x86...</em></p>\n<p>What is the equivalent in macOS?</p>\n"
