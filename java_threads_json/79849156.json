    "body": "<p>I have a list of items - for each item i want to send a message. But i don't want to loop through my list and send all the messages all at once - when message 1 sends successfully, I will have an indication of success/failure (e.g. publish a Spring Application Event). Then upon receiving the success signal I want to send message 2 etc. How do I achieve this in Java/Spring? i.e. how do I create tasks that wait for an outcome and then run again?</p>\n<p>I suppose I could keep have another array/list to keep track of which messages have been sent and use the success signal to trigger the next message to be sent, but is there a better way?</p>\n"
