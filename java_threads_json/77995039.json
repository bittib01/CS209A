    "title": "Parent Span is getting ended after propagating to a completable future",
    "body": "<p>I have a Service class that is calling a DAO method from a CompletableFuture.supplyAsync() method with a Context-wrapped Executor service. Here the propagation is working fine and can see the same parent span active., but the moment I invoke a DB call, a child span is created, and the parent span is ended. Is there a way to keep the parent span alive until the complete process finishes?</p>\n<p>Here I am using the otel spring boot starter with spring boot 3</p>\n<p>followed this for wrapping :\n<a href=\"https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/issues/6201\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/issues/6201</a></p>\n<p>Span.currentSpan().isRecording() is true before starting the CF.</p>\n"
