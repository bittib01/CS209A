    "title": "Google Tink: extract raw key in bytes format from Aead",
    "body": "<p>I have two Spring Boot V3 apps in Java 21 that communicate over Kafka using envelop-encryption.\nThe producer uses Google Tink AeadGcm to encrypt the data. Then, the DEK is encrypted with a KEK, encoded in Base64, and sent as a Kafka header.\nThe consumer receives the encryptedDek, decodes it from Base64 to bytes and decrypts it. Then, <strong>the consumer should create an <code>Aead</code> object by using the DEK to decrypt the data</strong>.</p>\n<p>The consumer keeps throwing <code>javax.crypto.AEADBadTagException: Tag mismatch</code> and I believe the issue may be related to how I extract the raw key (DEK) from the Aead object. Hence the question: how to properly extract in bytes format the raw key from an Aead object so that I can send it over the network?</p>\n"
