    "title": "Run Android applications that run WebView independently of browsers",
    "body": "<p>I am working on creating Android applications written in Java that run WebView for the front end completely and the backend using Java. After a while, I found a problem when I open one of these applications Which runs WebView for the front end, and when I forcefully stop the browser, my application stops.</p>\n<p>What is the solution to make applications work completely independently of browsers? I think it is a big problem for me because the browser may crash or suffer from a malfunction, and my applications that run WebView will stop.</p>\n"
