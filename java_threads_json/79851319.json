    "title": "How to safely pass per report configuration between two separate JARs in INET (report engine)?",
    "body": "<p>I am working with an enterprise system (Multi instance system i.e each client have their own Database with their own URL) where reports are executed on a single JVM. The reports may run for several minutes, and multiple reports can overlap, each using a different database.</p>\n<p>Here is the detailed situation:\nI have two separate JARs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>JAR A contains a method <code>processData(String input)</code> that needs some configuration value at runtime for transforming database field and is directly used in INET rpt files.</li>\n<li>JAR B is responsible for preparing that configuration value before the report runs as this jar have the DB connection.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I cannot modify the reports themselves, cannot add parameters (as currently parameters are handled differently in code base), and cannot introduce new tables or views for reports.</p>\n<p>Reports execute, and I don’t have a clear hook for the start or end of the report execution. Multiple reports may execute concurrently, each using its own database.</p>\n<p>My goal is to make the configuration value (The value come from DB) available to the method in JAR A during the report execution and ensure that:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Each report uses its own database specific configuration.</li>\n<li>Reports do not interfere with each other if they run at the same time.</li>\n<li>No permanent global state is shared between reports.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I am aware of <code>ThreadLocal</code> , but I am unsure how the reporting engine handles threads internally. I do not know if it creates worker threads or reuses a pool, and the documentation is not clear on that.</p>\n<p>Given this scenario, what are the safe approaches to make a per-report configuration available across two separate JARs? How can I ensure isolation between overlapping reports on different databases if I can not control the report lifecycle?</p>\n<p>I need a solution that do not require modifying existing reports and can handle multiple overlapping reports on the same JVM.</p>\n<p>For reference of INET: <a href=\"https://www.inetsoftware.de/en/i-net-clear-reports/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.inetsoftware.de/en/i-net-clear-reports/</a></p>\n"
