    "title": "Running Multiple Application Instances on Different Branches in IntelliJ - Potential Class Loading Issues?",
    "body": "<p>I'm trying to understand how IntelliJ handles class loading when running multiple instances of a Java application on different branches.</p>\n<p>When you run an application directly from the IDE (like IntelliJ), it doesn't create a Jar file but runs the built class files and resources directly, right?</p>\n<p>Now, let's say I start my application on port 8080 from branch A in IntelliJ. Then, I checkout branch B and run the same application on port 8081.</p>\n<p>When switching from branch A to branch B, the working directory changes according to the new branch.\nThe class files in my working directory would now correspond to branch B.\nSince Java loads classes dynamically, it might not load all the classes initially but only when they are needed later.\nCould there be a situation where, when the application tries to load a class later, it fails because the class files from branch A are no longer available due to the checkout to branch B?\nI'm curious if this scenario could cause issues and how IntelliJ or Java handles such cases. Any insights would be appreciated!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/AluPxn8J.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/AluPxn8J.png\" alt=\"How I ran two applications1\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/eCTfWovI.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/eCTfWovI.png\" alt=\"How I ran two applications2\" /></a></p>\n"
