    "title": "Hibernate envers force child entity revision when parent entity changes",
    "body": "<p>I have current manual auditing process using JPA and Hibernate. I am using same tables for storing all versions of entities. Current version will have active flag as <code>'Y'</code>.</p>\n<p>e.g. <code>employeees</code> -&gt; <code>adresses</code>. This is my entity structure:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>When employee is saved, I will insert new row in <code>employees</code> (with new guid PK).</li>\n<li>Insert corresponding rows in adresses table with foreign key as new generated PK.</li>\n<li>Update previous active record in employeees as inactive.</li>\n<li>Update newly inserted record as active.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>With this approach, it's easier to find all the parent-child data on each version of parent.</p>\n<p>Now I want to maintain versions in separate tables instead of the same one. e.g. <code>employeees_aud</code>, <code>adresses_aud</code>.</p>\n<p>I checked Hibernate envers to audit the changes. But it only inserts a new revision in audit when anything changes. I cannot force child entities to get audited.</p>\n<p>One way is to add extra field in all child tables and touch the field when parent entity is being saved. But I don't want to add these new fields.</p>\n<p>Is there better way of doing this in Hibernate envers?</p>\n"
