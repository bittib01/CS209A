    "body": "<p>Consider the following code:</p>\n<pre><code>public class Example {\n\n     static { System.out.println(Example.value); }\n\n     static final int value = 7;\n\n     public static void main(final String[] args) {    }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I expected it not to compile, since value is used before it's declared. Why does this work?</p>\n<p>I then tried with this code, and this doesn't compile as I expected</p>\n<pre><code>public class Example {\n\n    static{ System.out.println(value); }\n\n    static final int value = 7;\n\n    public static void main(final String[] args) {    }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This version does not compile, and gives an Illegal forward reference error — which is what I originally expected.</p>\n<p>The question is: Why are these two cases treated differently?</p>\n<p>I have noticed another problem I would love to understand.\nIf I use the first code and use a Integer.parseInt(&quot;7&quot;); it compiles (I don't know why but I think for the same reason of the first code, so because i used the Example.value and not value) but this time doesn't print 7 but 0, surely I can understand that runtime is treated differently but that 0 is surely a default value i think, but final variable can't have default value. So why it compiles, and it also prints 0 (default value)?</p>\n<pre><code>public class Example {\n\n    static{ System.out.println(Example.value); }\n\n    static final int value = Integer.parseInt(&quot;7&quot;);\n\n    public static void main(final String[] args) {    }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n"
