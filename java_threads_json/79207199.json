    "body": "<p>I have a Spring Boot application in which I am connecting to SQL Server, Sybase, Oracle and MySQL database to get metadata details. While collecting rows count of a tables with below code in Oracle\n<code>Resultset.getlong(&quot;rowcount&quot;)</code>\nI'm getting below error\nSQL exception - numeric overflow.</p>\n<p>When the rowcount is greater than the long max value we are getting this error. Ideally, we don't want to throw the exception, we want to catch it and do some work around for it.</p>\n<p>As like we got SQL exception with numeric overflow flow in Oracle, we want to know what kind of exception and message I will get for SQL Server and Sybase database servers.</p>\n<p>We cannot create tables with that many rows in our dev environment database to test it.</p>\n"
