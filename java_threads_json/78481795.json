    "title": "Java FFM, how to link a java object with a C struct?",
    "body": "<p>I'd like to know how I can &quot;link&quot; a C struct to an object in Java with the FFM library.\nI have a game in Java, and I'd ultimately like to allow users to create Luau scripts to interface with my game through an API. What I'm looking for is a way to send a &quot;Player&quot; object into C (to inevitably reach Lua), such that any changes made to the player through Java are immediately reflected in C (Lua as well), and any changes made in C/Lua are immediately reflected in Java where the core game logic is running.</p>\n<p>I'd like for the player to remain accessible as long as it hasn't been explicitly freed</p>\n<p>I can't really find any info on this topic, one potential solution I've thought of is to map a function for each operation I want to allow in C which calls a Java function and sets the player fields in java then maps it back to C again</p>\n"
