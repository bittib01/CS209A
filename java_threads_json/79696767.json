    "body": "<p>My friend asked me to make a step counter app, but i've encountered a problem. When i get the number of steps taken bu the user using sensorEvent.values[0], it counts the steps from the last reboot. Yet i need the app to work so that it takes steps per day, not per reboot or per launch.</p>\n<p>I tried to set the sensorEvent.values myself, but that did not work. I want so that if the app detects that the current date isnt the date written in shared preferences, it resets the step counter, yet with it working by sensorEvent.values[0], i have no idea how to.</p>\n"
