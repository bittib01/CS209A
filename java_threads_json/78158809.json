    "body": "<p>I am working on a JavaCard, so a SIM card that runs Java (or a subset of it: Java Embedded). Due to memory limitations I have an array that I reuse for multiple tasks.</p>\n<p>I want a function to basically return a pointer to that array, with an offset, thus a slice. This way I can be sure that no part of that array will be overwritten by accident.</p>\n<p>Pointers dont exactly exist in Java, but is there a way to return a part of an array without copying it?</p>\n"
