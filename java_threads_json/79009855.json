    "body": "<p>I have a nested RecycleView:</p>\n<p>BodyRecycleView has each item is a DetailRecycleView\nDetailRecycleView has each item is a element\nelements in DetailRecycleView only shows when it's touched</p>\n<p>I think about saving time at creating step of BodyRecycleView so I skip creating dataset of elements in DetailRecycleView.</p>\n<pre><code>onBindViewHolder() \n</code></pre>\n<p>of BodyRecycleView only create DetailRecycleView with an empty dataset.\nDataset of elements in DetailRecycleView is created in</p>\n<pre><code>getItemCount() \n</code></pre>\n<p>of DetailRecycleView. It doesn't have problem in display but when touching on element to interact with, it sometimes it shows wrong element.</p>\n<p>I tried to debug and found that when issue happen, it doesn't call</p>\n<pre><code>onCreateViewHolder() \n</code></pre>\n<p>of element has problem. In normal situation, it should call like this:</p>\n<pre><code>onCreateViewHolder()\nViewHolder constructor\nonBindViewHolder()\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>ViewHolder constructor\n</code></pre>\n<p>and</p>\n<pre><code>onBindViewHolder() \n</code></pre>\n<p>hasn't been called so it shows element in other DetailRecycleView;\nMaybe put initialization of dataset in</p>\n<pre><code>getItemCount() \n</code></pre>\n<p>makes this problem. Is there any way to keep my approaching and pass this situation?</p>\n"
