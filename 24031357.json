    "body": "<p>Currently, I am developing two webapps : </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>the core, developed in Java with Vert.x, receives data from a lot of other apps and sends it to client) </li>\n<li>the client, developed in PHP/JS, display data from the core.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The client isn't on the same domain as my core for the production phase.</p>\n\n<p>Since my development period, the two webapps are hosted in the same computer. I used \"ws:\\\\localhost:9090\" to connect my client to my core and I had no problem to transfer data.</p>\n\n<p>But, today, I try to replace localhost with my IP Address and, it didn't work :s</p>\n\n<p>I think that it's because the client isn't in the same domain as the core. But I don't know how I can correct this problem ?</p>\n\n<p>Do you have any idea ?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks !</p>\n\n<p>Code example (based on my code but not my code ;) ):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>For the core : <a href=\"http://pastebin.com/h2ZnBvQJ\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://pastebin.com/h2ZnBvQJ</a></li>\n<li>For the client : <a href=\"http://pastebin.com/DR5BeABf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://pastebin.com/DR5BeABf</a> </li>\n</ul>\n"
